In Q3, the company reported strong financial performance with a 16.9% comparable brand revenue growth, driven by all brands and both channels. West Elm and Pottery Barn delivered outstanding comps of 22.5% and 15.9%, respectively.

The exceptional results are attributed to the company's unique market positioning, proprietary products, vertically integrated sourcing and production, and digital-first operating model. Despite supply chain disruptions, the company's resilience and execution enabled it to minimize production and delivery delays, with 85% of holiday receipts received.

Macro trends, including strong housing market, hybrid work arrangements, online shopping shift, and consumer demand for sustainability, are driving growth opportunities. The company's commitment to sustainability has earned industry recognition and is a key differentiator.

Cross-brand and global expansion initiatives are contributing to growth, with the B2B initiative achieving record performance and the cross-brand credit card program enhancing customer engagement. The company's loyalty program and focus on first-party data will provide a competitive advantage in a cookie-less future.

Despite ongoing supply chain challenges, the company expects a return to normalized inventory levels by mid-2022 and has raised its full-year outlook to revenue growth of 22% to 23% and operating margins of 16.9% to 17.1%.

Confident in its long-term growth prospects, the company maintains a strong balance sheet with ample cash and no debt. It anticipates continuing its success through its growth strategies, proprietary products, operating model, and strong financial position.
