La-Z-Boy Incorporated reported strong financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2022, highlighted by record-high sales of $576 million, a 29% increase from pre-pandemic levels. Sales in the wholesale segment grew 28%, while the retail segment saw an increase of 19% and Joybird, the company's e-commerce brand, experienced a 37% jump in revenue. The company's expansion of production capacity and pricing actions have helped to offset rising raw material costs. Despite supply chain disruptions and rising freight costs, the company expects strong shipments, particularly in the fourth quarter. La-Z-Boy continued to return value to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. The company also recently acquired the Furnico upholstery manufacturing business in the UK, strengthening its international supply chain. Looking ahead, La-Z-Boy is focused on executing its Century Vision strategy, which includes leveraging its brand, investing in Joybird, and enhancing enterprise capabilities. The company expects to continue navigating supply chain challenges and anticipates a full-year consolidated non-GAAP operating margin at or near double digits.
