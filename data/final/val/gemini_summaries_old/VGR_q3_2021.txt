Vector Group reported a strong third quarter with revenue growth and increased market share in both its tobacco and real estate segments. The tobacco business, driven by price increases and promotional efficiencies, saw increased earnings and retail market share. Liggett's retail share grew to 4.22% from 4.18% in the year-ago period, while industry retail shipments decreased 7%. Vector Group's real estate brokerage business, Douglas Elliman, experienced a significant increase in revenue and profitability, with a 100% increase in closed sales volume and a doubling of revenue compared to the same period last year. The company's strong financial position, with $524 million in cash and cash equivalents and $214 million in investment securities, supports its plans to spin off Douglas Elliman into a separate publicly traded company. The spin-off will create value for stakeholders, leverage Douglas Elliman's comprehensive suite of real estate solutions, and provide access to capital markets for growth opportunities.
