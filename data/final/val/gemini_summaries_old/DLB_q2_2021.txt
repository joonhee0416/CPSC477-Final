Dolby's Q2 performance exceeded expectations with revenue coming in higher than the estimated $280 million to $310 million range. Notably, licensing revenues remained strong, growing 10% in the first half of fiscal 2021 compared to the previous year. This growth was driven by increased adoption of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos technologies, particularly in music and gaming. Gaming consoles like Microsoft Xbox and mobile devices like the Lenovo Legion Phone Duel 2 are now supporting the combined Dolby experience. Dolby Atmos for music is also gaining traction, with streaming services like Hungama, TIDAL, and Amazon Music now offering it. Furthermore, cinema-related revenue is expected to grow in the second half as the industry recovers. Dolby.io, the company's developer platform, offers new opportunities to engage users with interactivity and improved media quality, which will continue to drive revenue and earnings growth. The company anticipates third-quarter revenue in the range of $260 million to $290 million and non-GAAP earnings per share between $0.37 and $0.52.
