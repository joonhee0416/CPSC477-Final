Extra Space Storage had an outstanding quarter, with exceptional same-store occupancy, increased pricing power, and a significant rise in other income. This resulted in 18.4% same-store revenue growth and 27.8% same-store NOI growth. External growth initiatives contributed to 41.2% FFO growth. Despite rising acquisition costs, the company maintains a selective investment approach, focusing on FFO per share accretion. Strong performance in third-party management resulted in 96 additional stores, partially offset by dispositions. The company raised its annual FFO guidance by $0.28 at the midpoint due to continued strong fundamentals. Despite seasonal occupancy moderation, occupancy is expected to remain similar to 2020 year-end levels. Anticipated dilution from acquisitions was reduced to $0.11, with a target of $700 million in investments for the year. Payroll pressure is expected to continue in 2022, impacting payroll and G&A expenses. However, the company has strong access to capital and a favorable leverage ratio, providing ample opportunities for future investment.
