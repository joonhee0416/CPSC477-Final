2021 was a record-breaking year for Herbalife Nutrition, with annual net sales hitting $5.8 billion, a 5% increase from the previous year. The company set annual net sales records in its top three regions (Asia Pacific, North America, and EMEA) and 37 individual markets. Sales growth was driven by strong demand for nutrition products, leading to annual records in reported net income ($447 million) and adjusted EBITDA ($874 million). The company also achieved a record high of over 500,000 active sales leaders per month, a 9% increase compared to 2020.

However, the fourth quarter saw a 7% decline in net sales compared to Q4 2020. Despite this, the company saw growth on a two-year stack basis compared to Q4 2019. Asia Pacific and North America continued to drive growth, while EMEA faced challenges due to a difficult comparison period. China and Mexico also experienced sales declines due to pandemic-related disruptions.

Despite facing cost pressures in its supply chain and increased expenses related to in-person distributor events, Herbalife Nutrition anticipates a return to year-over-year growth in the back half of 2022. The company is initiating net sales guidance for the year in the range of flat to 6% growth and expects adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.25 to $4.75. Herbalife Nutrition plans to offset cost pressures through pricing adjustments and productivity improvements. The company is also executing a transformation program aimed at improving efficiency and scalability, with expected ongoing incremental savings in SG&A.
