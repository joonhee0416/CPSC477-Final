Raymond James Financial reported a record fiscal year with outstanding quarterly results driven by strong performance across its businesses. The firm generated record quarterly net revenues of $2.7 billion, a 30% year-over-year increase, and record quarterly net income of $429 million, resulting in earnings per diluted share of $2.02.

Financial advisors and associates played a crucial role in delivering these results, with the Private Client Group generating record quarterly net revenues of $1.8 billion. Capital Markets also reported record quarterly net revenues of $554 million, driven by record investment banking revenues. The Asset Management segment achieved record net revenues of $238 million and record pre-tax income of $114 million.

Raymond James Financial ended the quarter with record total client assets under administration of $1.18 trillion, up 27% year-over-year. The Private Client Group achieved record assets and fee-based accounts of $627 billion. The company also reported strong loan growth at Raymond James Bank, with total loans increasing 5% sequentially to a record $25 billion.

As the firm enters fiscal 2022, it expects to continue investing in people and technology, increase business development expenses, and provide bank loan loss provisions for credit losses associated with net loan growth. The company's pre-tax margin target is set at the top end of the 15% to 16% range, with upside potential depending on Capital Markets revenues.

Raymond James Financial remains focused on long-term growth, including organic growth, technology investments, and strategic M&A. The recently announced acquisitions of TriState Capital and Charles Stanley Group are examples of the firm's commitment to these initiatives.
