Greenhill reported a solid Q4 with revenue of $106.7 million and EPS of $1.05, significantly exceeding estimates. However, annual revenue declined by 14% to $301 million, and EPS fell 68% to $0.45. Despite lower global transaction activity, Greenhill's revenue declined primarily due to reduced activity in Europe. However, the firm experienced growth in restructuring advisory revenue and strong performance in capital advisory and M&A. The compensation ratio for the year was slightly above target at 59%, and non-compensation operating expenses were similar to last year. Greenhill has implemented a $60 million share repurchase program for 2020 and ended Q4 with $54.3 million of remaining authority. The company has a favorable outlook for 2020, with a strong pipeline of assignments in Europe, expanding restructuring advisory backlog, and positive conditions in capital advisory. Greenhill's strategy focuses on diversification and growth through acquisitions, team expansion, and internal talent development. The firm has a strong culture, a reputable brand, and high employee ownership, which drive recruitment success and performance.
