Brinker International's Q4 2020 earnings call highlighted the strong performance of its Chili's brand despite the pandemic, with top-line growth and a positive cash flow. Chili's generated significant sales improvement throughout the quarter, outperforming the casual dining sector with comparable sales down just 10.9% year-over-year. The company's strategic focus on off-premise and digital expansion, combined with aggressive cost management, led to a 6.4% restaurant operating margin. Notably, Chili's launched "It's Just Wings," a virtual brand that has the potential to rank among the top 200 restaurant brands and drive additional revenue.

For Q1 2021, Brinker expects consolidated comp sales to decline in the low to mid-teens range and an adjusted net loss per diluted share in the range of $0.25 to $0.40. However, the company anticipates positive operating cash flow and a strong balance sheet with liquidity exceeding $575 million. Brinker's long-term strategy has proven effective during the pandemic, and the company remains well-positioned for continued market share growth as dining restrictions ease and its virtual brand gains traction.
