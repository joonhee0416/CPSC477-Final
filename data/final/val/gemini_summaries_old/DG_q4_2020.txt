Dollar General delivered strong fourth-quarter and full-year results, driven by growth in non-consumable categories, increased average basket size, and enhanced in-store experiences. Despite a challenging environment, the company's value and convenience proposition resonated with customers, resulting in an 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year comp sales growth in non-consumable categories. Same-store sales increased 12.7% in Q4, with an increase of 10% to 12% on a two-year stack basis. Earnings per share rose 24.8% to $2.62, driven by strong sales growth and operating margin expansion.

Moving forward, Dollar General anticipates a 2% decline to flat net sales in 2021 and a same-store sales decline of 4% to 6%, but with growth of approximately 10% to 12% on a two-year stack basis. The company expects earnings per share in the range of $8.80 to $9.50, representing a 15% to 20% compound annual growth rate or 14% to 19% on an adjusted basis over a two-year period. Gross margin is likely to face pressure due to a shift in sales mix towards consumables and higher markdowns. However, the company's strategic initiatives, such as its non-consumables initiative (NCI) and DG Fresh, which aims to reduce product costs on frozen and refrigerated items, are expected to contribute positively to operating profit and margin in 2021.

Dollar General continues to invest in its operating priorities, including driving profitable sales growth, capturing growth opportunities, reinforcing its low-cost operator position, and investing in its teams. The company plans to expand its NCI offering to over 11,000 stores, accelerate the rollout of its pOpshelf concept to up to 50 locations, and introduce two new store formats with expanded cooler counts and broader product assortments. Additionally, Dollar General estimates approximately 17,000 new store opportunities available across its format types, with pOpshelf and its smaller footprint DGX format contributing to this growth potential. The company's digital initiatives, such as DG Pickup and its mobile app, will complement its brick-and-mortar footprint, enhancing customer convenience and engagement. By maintaining its focus on value, convenience, and disciplined cost management, Dollar General aims to drive long-term sustainable growth and shareholder value creation.
