**Earnings Summary for Clean Harbors**

Despite challenges posed by the pandemic, Clean Harbors reported a strong Q1 with revenue growth of 10%. Adjusted EBITDA reached a record $122.6 million, driven by favorable project work and emergency response revenue. Environmental Services and SK Oil businesses contributed to growth.

However, the company anticipates a decline in the second quarter, particularly in Safety-Kleen, due to reduced driving and business activity. Safety-Kleen's margin is also being impacted by a drop in base oil prices.

In response, Clean Harbors has implemented cost-cutting measures, including workforce reductions, hiring freezes, and restricted travel. It has also closed half of its rerefining capacity and negotiated cost reductions with suppliers. To strengthen liquidity, the company drew down $150 million on its credit line and reduced its planned net CapEx spend by over $50 million.

Despite near-term challenges, Clean Harbors believes its strong balance sheet and financial flexibility will enable it to weather the downturn. It expects Environmental Services to perform well, while Safety-Kleen will likely be more impacted. The company will focus on managing costs and pursuing new waste streams to improve its financial performance. Overall, Clean Harbors remains optimistic about its long-term prospects and intends to remain opportunistic in acquisitions once conditions improve.
