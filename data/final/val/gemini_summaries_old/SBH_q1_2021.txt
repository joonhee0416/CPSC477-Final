In Q1, SBH faced pandemic headwinds that resulted in a 3.7% decline in same-store sales, but despite this, it delivered strong profitability and cash flow. Gross margin remained robust at 50.3%, driven by the company's "fewer, bigger, deeper" strategy. Adjusted earnings per share grew 6% to $0.50. Strong execution, cost controls, and margin management contributed to these positive financial results. SBH's transformation journey, which included investments in digital capabilities, supply chain upgrades, and customer loyalty initiatives, is nearing completion, positioning the company for future growth. While the environment remains challenging in Q2 with ongoing COVID disruptions, SBH anticipates a modest softening of net sales from Q1 levels. The company remains focused on optimizing its investment and expenses, and expects to return to consistent top-line growth when pandemic headwinds abate. Overall, SBH's strong underlying business and execution provide confidence in its long-term success.
