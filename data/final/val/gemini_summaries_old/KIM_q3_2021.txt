Kimco Realty Corporation reports strong Q3 results, highlighted by an increase in FFO to $0.32 per diluted share, driven by contributions from the recently acquired Weingarten portfolio. The merger has exceeded expectations, with occupancy and renewal rates surpassing initial projections. Across the portfolio, leasing demand remains robust, with occupancy increasing to 94.1%, and positive leasing spreads maintained. The company's balance sheet has also improved, leading to a pro forma net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 6.3 times. Kimco actively manages its capital, using the ATM equity program and issuing a new unsecured bond at historically low interest rates. The company expects to continue with its investment and redevelopment strategies, including the potential monetization of its Albertsons investment. Kimco raised its full-year 2021 NAREIT FFO per share guidance range to $1.36 to $1.37, reflecting the successful integration of the Weingarten portfolio. The company's strong performance positions it for sustainable growth and the pursuit of opportunities in a favorable market environment.
