Synchrony Financial's third quarter financial results reflected broad-based strength across its business. Purchase volume grew 16% year-over-year, driven by strong consumer demand. Average active accounts increased 5% to 67.2 million. Net interest margin improved by 165 basis points to 15.45%, primarily due to the reduction in excess liquidity. Operating expenses decreased by 10% compared to last year, resulting in an efficiency ratio of 38.7%. Credit performance remained strong, with net charge-offs down to 2.18%. The company also returned $1.4 billion in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.

Importantly, Synchrony is continuing to invest in its product suite and innovative digital capabilities. The company recently launched new products and partnerships, including an expanded strategic partnership with Fiserv and a new PayPal savings account. Synchrony is also exploring ways to cross-sell products to existing merchants and customers.

Looking ahead, the company expects the third quarter's key operating trends to remain stable in the fourth quarter. Purchase volume is expected to remain strong, partially offset by elevated payment rates. Net interest margin is likely to be consistent with the third quarter, and provision for credit losses will continue to reflect asset growth, credit performance, and macroeconomic factors. Operating expenses are expected to increase slightly in the fourth quarter on a sequential basis.
