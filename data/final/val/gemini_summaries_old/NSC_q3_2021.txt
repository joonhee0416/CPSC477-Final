Norfolk Southern reported impressive third quarter results, with a 14% revenue increase despite flat volume. This growth was driven by improved revenue per unit and revenue per unit less fuel. The operating ratio of 60.2% reflects a 230 basis point improvement year-over-year, marking their second-best performance ever.

The company experienced ongoing challenges in intermodal due to supply chain disruptions, leading to a 4% volume decline. However, they saw strong growth in merchandise, coal, and other segments. Merchandise benefited from recovering energy demand and growth in steel markets, while coal demand remained robust due to global economic recovery.

Norfolk Southern is addressing labor shortages and hiring challenges through initiatives such as increased conductor trainee ranks, bonuses, and Go Teams. They are also prioritizing capacity growth to meet increased demand and accommodate variations in customer needs. This includes increasing train size, optimizing network utilization, and investing in technology to improve efficiency.

The company is optimistic about the fourth quarter, expecting continued robust revenue growth driven by strong consumer demand and ongoing economic recovery. Despite ongoing supply chain constraints, they remain confident in their ability to execute their plan and generate value for shareholders.
