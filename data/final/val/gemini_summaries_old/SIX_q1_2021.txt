Six Flags Entertainment Corporation reported strong demand trends despite challenges from the pandemic. They reopened all theme parks except for Montreal, with attendance at open parks increasing to 79% of pre-pandemic levels compared to 51% in the previous quarter. While experiencing some operational challenges due to labor shortages, the company is optimistic about the outlook. Total guest spending per capita increased, driven by higher realized ticket deals and strong in-park spending. Six Flags has a large active pass base of 4.1 million pass holders, which provides recurring revenue and smooths out cash flow. The company's transformation plan is expected to unlock $80 million to $110 million in incremental annual EBITDA once fully implemented and attendance returns to 2019 levels. Six Flags is also introducing new record-breaking and first-of-their-kind rides, as well as investing in park infrastructure and guest experience enhancements such as technology and food quality. The company's unique value proposition, strategic initiatives, and talented team position it for future growth and shareholder value enhancement.
