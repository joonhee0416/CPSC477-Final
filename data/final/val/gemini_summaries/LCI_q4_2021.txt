In Q4, Lannett faced competitive pressure that impacted sales and margins, resulting in a $0.19 adjusted loss per share. Despite this, the company achieved key milestones by launching new products, advancing its insulin and respiratory pipelines, and securing strategic partnerships. Lannett's robust pipeline includes 13 ANDAs pending at the FDA, four approved and pending launch, and 20 products in development. The company expects to generate $400-$440 million in net sales for fiscal 2022, with a gross margin of 23-25%. Lannett's successful debt refinancing extended its debt maturity to 2026, freeing up cash flow and improving its capital structure. With its pipeline expected to contribute meaningfully in future years, Lannett maintains its goal of becoming a $1 billion company by 2025.
