Winnebago Industries concluded a strong fiscal year 2021 with record revenues and profitability, attributed to increased outdoor lifestyle demand, expanded market share, and operational excellence. Q4 revenues grew 40.4% year-over-year and 56.8% on an organic basis, driven by demand for their premium products. Market share grew by 2.1 percentage points in the quarter, reflecting strong demand from both experienced and new consumers. Despite supply chain disruptions and inflation, Winnebago's operational efficiency enabled margin expansion in both motor home and towable segments, resulting in record consolidated gross margins of 17.9%. The company is investing in capacity expansion and M&A opportunities, including the recent acquisition of Barletta Boat Company, to meet growing demand. Winnebago anticipates continued growth in the outdoor recreation economy and remains bullish about its future, citing sustained interest in outdoor experiences and plans to offer a more diverse range of products. Despite cost input inflation, the company has implemented price increases to offset costs, and demand remains strong, with retail sales expected to reach a near-record level in fiscal year 2022.
