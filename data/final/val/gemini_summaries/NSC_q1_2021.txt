Norfolk Southern achieved strong first-quarter results despite supply chain disruptions caused by severe winter weather. Revenue increased 1% to $2.6 billion due to volume growth of 3%, while expenses declined 3% to $1.6 billion. This resulted in a record-breaking operating ratio of 61.5%, a 220-basis-point improvement year-over-year. The team's focus on efficiency initiatives, including workforce asset and fuel productivity, led to an increase in GTMs per employee of 16% since the launch of the Top 21 operating plan in 2019. Intermodal revenue rose 17% year-over-year, supported by growth in e-commerce and a tight truck market. Coal revenue improved 5% due to export thermal shipments and demand for met and coke amid economic recovery. Merchandise revenue declined 4% as merchandise volume decreased 3%, but revenue per unit excluding fuel reached a record high. Looking ahead, Norfolk Southern expects continued revenue growth in 2021, driven by high single-digit volume growth in merchandise, intermodal, and coal segments. The company remains confident in its ability to improve the OR to a run rate of 60% by year-end.
