Teekay Tankers reported a significant financial improvement in Q4 2019, with a total adjusted EBITDA of $132 million (more than double the previous year) and an adjusted net income of $83 million (up significantly from Q4 2018). The company's pro forma net debt was reduced by $153 million, and its pro forma liquidity increased to $260 million. The positive momentum continued into early Q1 2020, with higher spot tanker rates secured. However, the coronavirus outbreak has since impacted the market, affecting demand and reducing rates. Despite this, the company believes the underlying tanker supply and demand fundamentals remain favorable, citing factors such as non-OPEC oil supply growth, potential oil demand rebound, and low tanker order volume. Additionally, the company emphasizes its strong operating leverage, which would generate significant free cash flow and earnings per share based on Q4 2019 rates. Ongoing efforts to reduce debt and strengthen the balance sheet are also highlighted.
