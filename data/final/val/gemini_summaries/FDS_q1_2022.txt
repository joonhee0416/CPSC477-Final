FactSet reported a strong start to fiscal 2022 with the highest Q1 incremental ASV on record. Organic ASV and professional services grew by 9% year-over-year, driven by high retention, expansion, and new business wins among institutional asset management clients. The company saw double-digit ASV growth from banking, wealth, hedge fund, and private equity clients. Adjusted operating margin exceeded guidance at 33.6%, supported by increased demand for differentiated content and workflow solutions. FactSet continues to invest in its digital platform, content refinery, and hyper-personalized workflow solutions, reaffirming its fiscal 2022 guidance. Despite higher expenses, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew by 13% to $3.25, and free cash flow amounted to $64 million.
