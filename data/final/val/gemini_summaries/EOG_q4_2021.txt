EOG had a successful 2021, with record earnings of $4.7 billion and free cash flow of $5.5 billion, which resulted in $2.7 billion returned to shareholders. The earnings increase in 2021, despite a lower oil price, is attributed to the company's commitment to its "premium" strategy, which involves investing in low-cost production. To further improve performance, EOG has implemented a "double premium" approach, which has resulted in higher margins and lower costs. The company plans to generate $11 billion in cash flow from operations in 2022, with a capital plan of $4.5 billion, leading to expected free cash flow of more than $6 billion. EOG remains committed to returning cash to shareholders through a $3 per share regular dividend and special dividends, with $2.3 billion already committed for 2022. Despite inflationary pressures, EOG is confident in its ability to maintain well costs through innovation and operational efficiency. In 2021, EOG replaced over two times what it produced, grew its reserve base by 500 million barrels of oil equivalent, and added over 700 premium locations to its inventory. The company emphasizes the importance of a disciplined capital investment strategy and believes that its unique culture, focus on technology, and commitment to ESG will continue to drive value for shareholders.
