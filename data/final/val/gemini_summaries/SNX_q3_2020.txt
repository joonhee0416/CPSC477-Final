In Q3, SYNNEX exceeded expectations with revenue of $6.5 billion, a 4% increase year-over-year. Consolidated gross profit declined slightly, while adjusted operating income fell 4% to $260 million, impacted by COVID-related costs of approximately $21 million. Technology Solutions revenue rose 5% to $5.3 billion, driven by strong demand in education and e-commerce channels. Conversely, Concentrix revenue grew marginally to $1.2 billion despite COVID challenges, with adjusted operating income reaching 10.1%. The company projects fourth-quarter revenue between $6.45 billion and $6.65 billion, with non-GAAP earnings per share estimated at $3.68 to $3.93. SYNNEX also remains on track to spin off Concentrix in December, with both companies expecting to have strong liquidity and growth opportunities.
