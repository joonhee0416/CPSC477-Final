In Q3 2021, home buying activity remained strong, with Meritage setting company records for home closing gross margin (29.7%) and diluted earnings per share ($5.25). Despite supply chain challenges, the company delivered a record 3,112 homes. Entry-level homes comprised 78% of closings, driven by ongoing demand from millennials and baby boomers. The company's focus on affordability, including strategic land acquisition and product mix adjustments, is expected to continue in the future. While supply chain issues are persisting, Meritage expects elongated cycle times to continue for the foreseeable future. Despite these challenges, the company projects 12,600 to 12,900 home closings for 2021, with gross margin remaining elevated and SG&A rate dropping below the current low 9s range in 2022. Meritage remains committed to its goal of 300 communities by mid-2022.
