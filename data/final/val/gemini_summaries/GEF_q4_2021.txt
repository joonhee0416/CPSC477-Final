Greif delivered strong fourth-quarter results despite challenges, with a 35% increase in net sales (excluding FX impacts) driven by volume growth and higher selling prices. Adjusted EBITDA rose by 57 million, despite headwinds from OCC index costs and transportation and manufacturing inflation. For fiscal 2021, earnings per share surged by 74% to $5.60. The company's strategic focus on ESG, including landfill diversion and sustainability initiatives, remains a key aspect of its business strategy. Looking ahead, Greif anticipates lower profits in its Global Industrial Packaging segment due to the tailwind from steel costs in 2021, but offsets this with strong demand and price increases in its Paper Packaging segment. Overall, fiscal 2022 guidance reflects the company's resilience and ability to generate adjusted earnings per share of $6.15. Additionally, the company remains focused on capital allocation and strategic growth while maintaining its commitment to return excess cash to shareholders through dividends and de-leveraging its balance sheet.
