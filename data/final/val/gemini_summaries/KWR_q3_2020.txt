Despite the pandemic's impact, Quaker Houghton saw sequential sales growth of 28% in Q3, primarily driven by volume increases in all regions and industry groups. Metalworking sales notably jumped 39%, while global specialties and metals also exhibited growth. Despite an overall 10% decline in pro forma volumes year-over-year, the company gained market share with total organic sales growth of 2%. Gross margins improved significantly, driven by cost savings from the company's integration and manufacturing optimization efforts. Cost synergies surpassed expectations, with $17 million achieved in the quarter and projected to reach $75 million in 2021. Management anticipates a gradual sequential improvement in markets over the next year or two, with adjusted EBITDA for the full year exceeding $215 million. Despite challenges posed by COVID-19, the company's asset-light business model allowed for strong cash flow, debt reduction, and improved leverage.
