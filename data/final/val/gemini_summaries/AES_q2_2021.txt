AES Corporation reported an impressive second quarter with a 24% surge in adjusted earnings per share, driven by execution of its strategic growth plan, recovering demand at U.S. Utilities, and reduced interest expenses. The company secured record long-term contracts, adding 1.8 gigawatts of renewables to its backlog, bringing the total to 8.5 gigawatts.

AES is on track to achieve its 7% to 9% annual growth in earnings per share and parent-free cash flow through 2025. Key milestones include transforming its U.S. Utilities through strategic investments and advancing renewables growth, with 90% of new contracts signed in the U.S. and over 80% negotiated bilaterally with commercial and industrial customers.

The company also made progress on its decarbonization efforts, with 1.1 gigawatts of coal-fired generation to be retired and replaced by 2.3 gigawatts of renewable energy in Chile. Additionally, AES highlighted its competitive advantage in innovation, citing the success of its Energy Storage business and the acquisition of prefabricated solar solution company 5B.

AES reaffirmed its 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $1.50 to $1.58, supported by strong credit metrics and a strong financial profile. The company plans to invest significantly in global renewables and U.S. Utilities, with approximately 60% of investments earmarked for renewables and 25% for utilities' rate-based growth.
