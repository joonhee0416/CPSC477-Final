U.S. Steel delivered record-setting performance in Q3, significantly outperforming peers. The company repaid over $2.7 billion of debt year-to-date and expects to have $5 billion in total liquidity by year-end. This strong financial position provides a foundation for investing in the company's competitive advantages: low-cost iron ore, mini mill steelmaking, and best-in-class finishing capabilities. U.S. Steel is expanding its mini mill capacity with Mini Mill Number Two and an electrical steel line at Big River Steel. These investments aim to increase EBITDA by $650 million and $60 million annually, respectively. The company is also enhancing its capital allocation priorities by reinstating a quarterly dividend and authorizing a $300 million stock buyback, recognizing the undervaluation of its progress by the market. Looking to 2022, the company expects strong selling prices based on contracted volumes. U.S. Steel anticipates average selling prices in the Flat-rolled segment to be higher than 2021. The company is also prioritizing collaboration with customers, discussing commercial terms beyond price, and exploring opportunities for long-term partnerships. Additionally, auto customers are indicating increased usage rates, suggesting a potential recovery from the chip shortage. Overall, U.S. Steel is positioned for continued success and delivering value to stockholders through its Best for All strategy.
