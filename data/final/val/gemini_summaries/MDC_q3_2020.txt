M.D.C. Holdings reported strong financial results for Q3 2020, with a 33% increase in home sale revenues to $1 billion and a remarkable 96% growth in net income to $98.9 million. This growth was driven by a 73% increase in net new orders and a 6% increase in average selling price of homes delivered. Despite increased costs, the company successfully recouped these through price increases, leading to a 370 basis point expansion in homebuilding operating margin and a 560 basis point increase in last 12-month pre-tax return on equity. The company estimates fourth-quarter home deliveries to range between 2,400 and 2,600 units, with average selling price exceeding $460,000. The Board of Directors has declared a 21% increase in quarterly cash dividend to $0.40 per share, reflecting the company's commitment to shareholder rewards.
