Endeavor reported strong second-quarter results, exceeding estimates with revenue of $1.1 billion. The company's owned sports properties segment saw significant growth driven by higher media rights and sponsorship fees, particularly in UFC, which held three record-breaking live events. The events and experiences segment also performed well, with revenue increases driven by media rights and production revenue. The talent representation segment experienced a slight timing delay in content deliveries, impacting revenue. Notably, Endeavor has begun the sale process for its Endeavor Content business and has received strong interest. The company raised its annual guidance to reflect positive trends and the recovery in its businesses. Revenue is now projected at $4.8-$4.85 billion, and adjusted EBITDA is expected to be $765-$775 million. Endeavor remains optimistic about future growth opportunities, particularly in sports betting, NFTs, and the D2C streaming market.
