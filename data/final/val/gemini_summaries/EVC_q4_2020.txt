Entravision's fourth-quarter performance exceeded expectations, with total revenues reaching $171.7 million, a significant jump from $70.8 million the previous year. This growth was primarily driven by political ad sales, which contributed $14.2 million to the quarter's revenues. Digital revenue also experienced a substantial increase, surging 424% year-over-year and surpassing television revenue to become the company's largest operating segment. Entravision's EBITDA also saw a remarkable increase of 195% to $32.6 million, with Cisneros Interactive's contribution playing a major role in this growth. Despite the absence of political ad revenue, the company anticipates a strong first quarter with TV, audio, and digital pacing positively. Entravision's digital expansion and acquisition strategy remain key areas of focus as they seek continued growth and profitability in the future.
