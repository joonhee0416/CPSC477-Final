Franklin Templeton, following the transformational acquisition of Legg Mason, reports a strong fiscal year. Through strategic acquisitions, the firm expanded its alternative asset business, including the notable addition of Lexington Partners, a leader in secondary private equity and co-investments. Alternative assets now comprise $145 billion in AUM, with management fees excluding performance fees expected to reach $1 billion in 2022. Other growth areas include separately managed accounts and ESG-specific strategies, both experiencing positive net flows. Despite a $9.9 billion net outflow in the fourth quarter, adjusted net income and earnings per share increased 31% for the quarter and 46% for the year. Franklin Templeton's strong financial position, with $6.93 billion in cash and investments, will continue to support shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases, while allowing for further investments and acquisitions in the growing asset management industry.
