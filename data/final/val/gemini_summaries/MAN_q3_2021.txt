ManpowerGroup's third-quarter revenue reached $5.1 billion, increasing 11% year-over-year in constant currency. The company's earnings per share (EPS) were $1.93, excluding acquisition and restructuring costs, exceeding market expectations. While supply chain disruptions and the Delta variant slowed growth in some markets, hiring demand remains strong globally. The acquisition of ettain, a leading IT staffing firm, has strengthened ManpowerGroup's IT services and geographic diversification. In Q4, the company projects revenue growth between 5% and 9% in constant currency, with EBITA margin improving by 30 basis points at the midpoint. Despite labor shortages, ManpowerGroup remains optimistic, investing in digital workforce solutions, upskilling, and reskilling programs to meet future demand for skilled talent.
