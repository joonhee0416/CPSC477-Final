Dollar General's fourth-quarter results showcased robust financial performance with earnings per share of $2.62, a 24.8% increase year-over-year. Same-store sales grew an impressive 12.7%, driven by increased basket size and unit purchases. Non-consumable categories continue to fuel growth, with a combined comp sales increase exceeding consumable sales for the 11th consecutive quarter. Despite challenges in customer traffic, Dollar General managed to increase market share in highly consumable product sales. Notably, the company observed an increase in new, younger, higher-income, and more ethnically diverse customers, indicating the broadening appeal of its value and convenience proposition. For the full-year 2020, Dollar General celebrated the opening of its 17,000th store and the launch of its newest concept, pOpshelf, while completing a record 2,780 real estate projects. The company invested heavily in strategic initiatives, including the acceleration of its NCI and DG Fresh programs, which have enhanced gross margin and increased product availability. Dollar General remained committed to expansion plans, with a target of 1,050 new stores, 1,750 remodels, and 100 relocations in 2021, as well as the addition of produce to approximately 700 stores. The introduction of two new store formats, a larger format with 8,500 square feet of selling space and a second format with 9,500 square feet, is designed to offer an expanded assortment and higher capacity coolers. Notably, the company estimates 13,000 additional small-box store opportunities, which, combined with pOpshelf and DGX opportunities, represent a significant growth runway. Dollar General remains confident in its ability to deliver long-term sustainable growth and create shareholder value.
