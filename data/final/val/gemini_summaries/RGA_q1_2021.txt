Despite reporting a loss of $1.24 in adjusted operating EPS, RGA emphasized the resilience of their core business and the value added by in-force transactions worth $100 million. Their Asia Traditional and Financial Solutions businesses performed well, as did U.S. Group and individual health. The U.S. Mortality business was significantly impacted by COVID-19 claims, but mortality performance over the past 12 months, excluding COVID-19 claims, has been in line with expectations. RGA remains optimistic about future growth as vaccination rates increase, reducing COVID-19 deaths. The company's strong fundamentals and ability to absorb over $1.2 billion in COVID-19 claims since the pandemic began highlight their financial strength. Notably, RGA has been ranked #1 for business capabilities globally by NMG for the 10th consecutive year.
