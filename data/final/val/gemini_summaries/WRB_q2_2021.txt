In the second quarter of 2021, the company achieved a consecutive record underwriting profit and strong investment income. Net premiums written surged by 27.2%, driven by growth across all segments except property reinsurance. Underwriting income skyrocketed by 800%, primarily due to rate improvements and lower claims frequency. On the investment front, net investment income jumped by 96.9%. The combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, improved significantly to 87.5%. Despite higher corporate expenses and above-average non-weather related property losses, the company maintained a solid expense ratio of 28.7%. Stockholders' equity grew by $164 million, and book value per share increased by 2.5%. The company anticipates strong growth ahead, supported by favorable market conditions and a continued focus on rate adequacy and exposure growth.
