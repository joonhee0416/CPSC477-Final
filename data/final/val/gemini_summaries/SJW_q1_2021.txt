San Jose Water Company, the parent company of SJW Group, provided an earnings update for the first quarter of 2021. Despite challenges posed by the pandemic, the company reported a slight revenue increase of 1% to $114.8 million, primarily driven by rate adjustments and customer growth in Texas. Net income for the quarter was $2.6 million, an 8% increase compared to the same period in 2020, resulting in earnings per share of $0.09.

The increase in diluted earnings per share was attributed to rate increases, cost savings, a tax benefit, and non-regulated income, partially offset by decreased customer usage, storm-related credits, and higher expenses. Water supply issues in California, including lower-than-expected rainfall and reduced surface water availability, are impacting the company's operations and increasing operating costs. As a result, San Jose Water has adjusted its 2021 earnings guidance to $1.85 to $2.05 per diluted share, assuming no additional surface water production for the remainder of the year.

The company also discussed its capital expenditure program, with $46.7 million invested in utility plant additions during Q1 2021. Financing activities included a stock offering that raised $66.9 million and the establishment of new credit agreements totaling $145 million. San Jose Water is continuing its growth strategy, acquiring a water system in Texas and investing in high-quality systems to enhance reliability and service.

Regulatory developments include general rate cases filed in California, Connecticut, and Maine to recover capital investments and expenses. San Jose Water is also considering proposals to assist low-income customers with water bill discounts and debt forgiveness. The company remains committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, as well as environmental sustainability efforts.
