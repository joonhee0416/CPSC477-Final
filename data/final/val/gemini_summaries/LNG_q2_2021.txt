Cheniere Energy reported strong financial performance for the second quarter of 2021, driven by favorable LNG market fundamentals and operational excellence. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA reached $1.023 billion, while distributable cash flow was $340 million on revenue of $3 billion. The company raised its full-year 2021 guidance to $4.6 billion to $4.9 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion in distributable cash flow, primarily due to higher LNG netbacks and increased production. Cheniere has made significant progress in commercializing its Corpus Christi Stage 3 project, signing an IPM agreement with Tourmaline and entering into fixed fee sales agreements for portfolio volumes totaling 12 million tons. The company continues to invest in ESG-related initiatives, including the publication of a corporate responsibility report and the implementation of QMRV and life cycle assessment tools. The global LNG market remains constructive, with demand growth surpassing the five-year range. European gas prices reached record highs, while Asian LNG imports surged, highlighting the growing global appetite for natural gas. Cheniere is well-positioned to meet this demand with its highly flexible portfolio volumes and cost-competitive brownfield incremental capacity. As natural gas solidifies its role in the energy transition, Cheniere is leading the industry in environmental transparency and performance, offering carbon-neutral LNG and collaborating on methane emissions reduction initiatives.
