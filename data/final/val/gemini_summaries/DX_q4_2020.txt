Dynex Capital reported strong 2020 performance with a 15.2% total economic return and a 17% total shareholder return, outperforming most mortgage REITs and other income-oriented investments. The company's discipline in risk management and capital allocation enabled it to take advantage of improving asset valuations and declining funding costs.

For the fourth quarter, Dynex recorded comprehensive income of $1.23 per common share and core net operating income of $0.45 per share. Realized and unrealized investment gains in TBA securities were key drivers of the company's returns.

Dynex's portfolio is currently positioned to benefit from a steeper yield curve, with 20% of its RMBS portfolio allocated to 15-year securities. The company has also increased its long-term option-based hedges to mitigate rising long-term rates.

Dynex remains focused on generating total economic returns that meet or exceed its dividend and has significant earnings power on its balance sheet. The company believes the current investment environment is favorable, with low and stable financing costs supporting its ability to opportunistically invest at more accretive levels.

Dynex's long-term track record demonstrates the benefits of its disciplined investment approach, risk management, and commitment to delivering superior returns. The company invites new investors to join its existing shareholders in pursuing its bright future.
