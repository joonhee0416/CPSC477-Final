For Q3 2021, the company reported net sales of $178.2 million and diluted earnings of $1.98 per share, marking significant increases from the previous year's $145.7 million and $1.39 per share. This surge in profitability was largely attributed to increased sales and production, leading to favorable cost leveraging. However, profitability declined compared to Q2 2021 due to a company-wide shutdown, increased COVID cases, and a decrease in excess resales. Despite these factors, the company generated $117 million in cash from operations during the first nine months of 2021, and reinvested $15.6 million into capital expenditures primarily related to new product development. Demand for products remained strong, with an increase in unit sell-through of 9% compared to a decrease of 11% in adjusted NICS background checks. New product development contributed $116 million to firearm sales, with products like the MAX-9 and LCP MAX pistols experiencing strong demand. Additionally, the company's workforce has grown by 20% since March 2020, leading to a 45% increase in quarterly unit production. Despite production growth, finished goods inventories remain near historic lows. The company's financial strength, characterized by a debt-free balance sheet and cash and short-term investments of $192.7 million, provides flexibility and security in managing challenges.
