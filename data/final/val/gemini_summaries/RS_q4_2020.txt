Reliance Steel & Aluminum achieved solid financial performance in 2020 amidst market volatility, driven by strong operational execution and margin discipline. Their 2020 gross profit margin reached a record 31.5%, exceeding their sustainable range of 28-30%. They also generated healthy profitability, with full-year non-GAAP earnings per share reaching $7.71. Furthermore, they maintained strong cash flow from operations of $1.17 billion, supported by efficient working capital management. In the fourth quarter of 2020, Reliance experienced improved demand across most end markets, resulting in a 1.3% decline in tons sold compared to Q3, the lowest seasonal decline in the past decade. The company saw a 4.6% increase in average selling price due to rising input costs and mill price increases. This contributed to a record gross profit margin of 33% in Q4, supported by effective price management. Looking ahead, Reliance anticipates continued favorable market conditions in Q1 2021, with an expected 10-12% increase in tons sold and a 12-14% increase in average selling price. The company forecasts non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $3.40 to $3.50 for Q1, reflecting their optimism about the upcoming quarter.
