Dolby's Q3 results outperformed expectations, with revenue reaching the high end of the scenario and earnings exceeding estimates due to tax benefits and lower operating expenses. Despite the pandemic's impact, total company revenue declined year-over-year, primarily attributed to COVID-19's effects on cinema and unit shipments. Licensing revenue remained strong, driven by mobile and consumer electronics markets. Operating expenses were lower than guidance due to marketing program timing adjustments. The company expects Q4 revenue to range from $225 million to $255 million, with licensing revenue growth offset by lower product and service revenue. Earnings per share are projected between $0.05 to $0.20 on a GAAP basis and $0.22 to $0.37 on a non-GAAP basis. For the full year, Dolby anticipates revenue between $1,115 million to $1,145 million, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share between $2.76 to $2.91, and remains optimistic about growth opportunities through expanded content availability and adoption of Dolby Vision and Atmos technologies across a range of devices.
