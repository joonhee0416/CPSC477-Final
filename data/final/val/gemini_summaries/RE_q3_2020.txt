Everest reported a strong third quarter with net income of $243 million, up from $104 million in Q3 2019. This was driven by gross written premium growth of 16% to $2.8 billion, improved attritional loss ratios in both Reinsurance and Insurance (excluding COVID-19), and higher investment income. The company also experienced $300 million in catastrophe losses and added $125 million to its COVID-19 loss provision, bringing its total year-to-date provision to $435 million. Despite these costs, Everest's attritional combined ratios improved year-over-year in both segments, reflecting the earnings power of the franchise. Everest strengthened its capital position with a $1 billion senior notes offering at a low 3.5% coupon over 30 years. The company's shareholders' equity now stands at $9.6 billion, resulting in a 7% increase in book value per share from year-end 2019. Everest's portfolio is well-diversified, with $7.7 billion in gross written premium year-to-date. The company is well-positioned to execute its growth strategy, supported by a strong capital base and access to favorable market opportunities.
