Rogers Corporation reported a robust first quarter driven by advanced mobility markets and ongoing recovery. Net sales increased 9% to $229 million, surpassing expectations. The company's gross margin reached 39% due to operational efficiency, offsetting higher commodity costs and an unfavorable product mix. EPS exceeded guidance, reaching $1.66 on a GAAP basis and a record $1.92 on an adjusted basis. Advanced mobility markets, including EV/HEV and ADAS, witnessed double-digit growth, with EV/HEV sales more than doubling year-over-year. Defense and industrial demand also surged, returning to pre-pandemic levels. While the UTIS facility disruption had minimal impact on sales, global supply chain disruptions began affecting growth in late Q1, expected to moderate by the end of Q2. For Q2, Rogers forecasts continued market strength and revenue guidance of $230 million to $240 million, with gross margin remaining flat sequentially before improving in the latter half of 2021 due to commercial actions mitigating raw material costs and increased volume.
