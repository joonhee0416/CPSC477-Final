Flowserve delivered solid third quarter earnings per share of $0.50, aligning with expectations. Despite challenges posed by COVID-19, cost actions drove a 13.8% decrease in adjusted SG&A, partially offsetting revenue declines. The Flowserve 2.0 Transformation program maintained operational execution, limiting the decline in adjusted operating margin to 60 basis points. Bookings declined 21% year-over-year, with noticeable slumps in oil and gas bookings due to project award declines. While aftermarket bookings remained stable, original equipment bookings exhibited modest growth. Management anticipates bookings to remain at second and third quarter levels in Q4 2020, with an expected inflection in mid-to-late 2021. Flowserve expects strong backlog conversion in Q4, contributing to the largest revenue quarter of the year. The company projects approximately $100 million in free cash flow generation for the quarter, driven by working capital reductions. Despite COVID-19 headwinds, Flowserve remains confident in its execution and ability to capture market recovery, driving long-term value for stakeholders.
