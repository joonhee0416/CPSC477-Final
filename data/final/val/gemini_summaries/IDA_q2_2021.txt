IDACORP's strong customer growth, economic recovery, and extreme heat during Q2 resulted in record-breaking earnings, with an EPS of $1.38, surpassing the previous quarter and year-to-date records. The company raised its full-year EPS guidance to $4.70-$4.90. Despite higher usage due to hot weather, a regulatory mechanism partially offset revenue gains for smaller customers. The Jim Bridger coal plant's depreciation expense acceleration filing aims to reduce customer costs long-term and aligns with the company's goal of providing 100% clean energy by 2045. Idaho Power's deferral of wildfire mitigation costs was approved by the Idaho Commission. Hydropower generation projections have been lowered due to weather conditions, but customer growth, transmission services, and cost management contribute to the positive earnings outlook. IDACORP maintains strong liquidity and does not anticipate raising equity capital in 2021.
