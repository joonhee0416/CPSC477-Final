IDACORP's second quarter earnings per diluted share of $1.38 reflect an increase of $0.19, while earnings over the first six months of 2021 totaled $2.27, up $0.33 from the same period last year. The company has raised its full-year 2021 earnings guidance to $4.70-$4.90 per share, assuming normal weather and economic conditions. Customer growth in Idaho Power's service area continues to drive demand, with a 2.9% increase since June 2020. Strong sales are expected in the third quarter due to hot dry weather, as hydro generation forecasts have decreased. An all-time peak load of 3,751 megawatts was reached on June 30, highlighting the rising energy demand. The Jackpot Solar project is expected to be operational by the end of 2022, while an RFP has been issued for an additional 80 MW of capacity. Idaho Power has made a filing to accelerate depreciation expenses at the Jim Bridger coal-fired plant, which could increase rates by $30.8 million this year but potentially save customers money in the long term. The company continues to defer wildfire mitigation costs and does not plan to file a general rate case in Idaho or Oregon in the next 12 months.
