Oxford Industries reported impressive Q3 results, driven by strong consumer demand and its effective strategy execution. Sales surged by 41% compared to last year, exceeding pre-pandemic levels in 2019. The direct-to-consumer business played a significant role, experiencing a 40% growth in full-price sales. These gains were attributed to powerful brand execution, an exceptional product portfolio, and successful customer engagement. The company achieved record third quarter earnings of $1.19 per share on an adjusted basis, a remarkable improvement from an adjusted loss of $0.44 per share last year. Oxford's gross margin expanded significantly, driven by a higher proportion of full-price sales and the shift towards higher-margin direct-to-consumer channels. The company exited its legacy Lanier Apparel business during the quarter, marking a strategic milestone. Looking ahead, Oxford expects a solid Q4 with continued strength in its full-price direct-to-consumer segment. Full-year sales and earnings are projected to exceed pre-pandemic levels. The company remains committed to its capital allocation priorities, including investments in its businesses, acquisitions, and returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
