ITW's Q3 2020 financial results surpassed expectations, with a 29% sequential revenue increase from $2.5 billion to $3.3 billion. Organic revenue declined by only 4.6% year-over-year, demonstrating resilience despite the pandemic. Excluding the impact of restructuring expenses and one-time segment items, operating margin would have increased to 25.3%, the second highest in the company's history. The Automotive OEM segment saw revenue essentially double, while Polymers & Fluids and Construction reported record growth of 6% and 8%, respectively. The recovery was broad-based geographically, with North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific (especially China), and South America all experiencing improvements. Despite ongoing challenges in Food Equipment and Welding, the company expects to end the year with free cash flow significantly above $2 billion.
