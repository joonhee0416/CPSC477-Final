Reliance Industries reported strong third-quarter results, highlighting the resilience of its diversified business model. Gross profit margin expanded to a record 32.4%, driven by higher tolling volumes, shifts in product mix, and price increases. Non-GAAP earnings per share increased 37.5% to $1.80, and the company generated strong cash flow from operations of $296.3 million. Demand in key end markets, including nonresidential construction and automotive, improved during the quarter, while energy and aerospace sectors remained challenged. The company anticipates continued gradual improvement in overall demand in the fourth quarter but expects a seasonal decline in shipping volumes. Non-GAAP earnings per share for the fourth quarter are projected to be in the range of $1.30 to $1.40. Reliance remains committed to its investment strategy, including capital expenditure, acquisitions, and stock repurchases, while maintaining a focus on cost control and customer service.
