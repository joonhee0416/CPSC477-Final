Lexington reported a solid financial performance, with adjusted company FFO reaching $0.22 per diluted share in Q1, driven by new acquisitions and lease termination income. Its industrial portfolio posted strong growth, with average base and cash base rent renewal increases of 14.6% and 5.4%, respectively. The company's healthy occupancy rate (97.8%) and increasing market rents are contributing to property value gains. Lexington purchased three industrial assets and completed a development project in Columbus, with an average estimated stabilized yield of 5.9%. Despite a competitive investment landscape, the company remains active with over $1 billion of investments under review. It also secured assets under contract or accepted offers amounting to $206 million. Development efforts include projects in Indianapolis and Central Florida, providing stabilized yields above those available in the fully leased building purchase market. Lexington's balance sheet is robust, with low leverage (net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 4.6 times) and ample liquidity ($170 million cash balance). Its ESG initiatives include setting long-term environmental targets and participating in industry-leading sustainability programs.
