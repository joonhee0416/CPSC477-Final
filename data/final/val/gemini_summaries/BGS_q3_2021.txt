Despite operating challenges, B&G Foods had a strong third quarter with sales of $515 million and adjusted EBITDA of $96.2 million. Base business net sales, excluding Crisco, grew 9.2% compared to 2019's pre-pandemic levels, led by strong performance in Green Giant and spices & seasonings. Higher commodities and logistics costs impacted margins, but B&G implemented price increases and cost savings initiatives to offset inflation. The company expects continued inflationary pressure and is actively managing supply chain issues and optimizing productivity. B&G's long-term goal is to achieve an 20% adjusted EBITDA margin through strategic acquisitions, portfolio optimization, and cost control measures.
