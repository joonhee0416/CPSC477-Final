Hersha Hospitality Company navigated the COVID-19 pandemic by implementing significant cost-saving measures and enhancing its operating model. It reduced operating expenses by 77% during the second quarter, targeting further cost savings of 300 to 500 basis points through zero-based budgeting and revised operating protocols, including reduced amenities and outsourced services. These measures allowed most properties to breakeven at 25-30% occupancy and a 60-70% RevPAR decline. Hersha also reduced its cash burn rate, which was 18% below its downside scenario, and extended its credit facility to June 30, 2021, with a full covenant holiday. The company's limited service drive-to resort offerings performed strongly, with the Sanctuary Beach resort reaching 71% occupancy in June. In urban gateway markets, Hersha leverages its operating model and partnerships with operators to source business from healthcare, government, and design/construction sectors. Despite the slow rebound in corporate travel, Hersha expects a strong recovery in New York City in the next 12-24 months, citing favorable supply-demand dynamics. The company remains cautiously optimistic about pending asset sales and is exploring additional strategies to fortify its balance sheet.
