RPT Realty saw improved rent collections at 91% for Q4, paid off its revolver balance, leaving it with over $400 million in liquidity. Despite the pandemic, the company maintained a 94% open portfolio and signed 120,000 square feet of leases, including new deals with healthcare providers. Looking ahead, RPT anticipates growth in 2021 driven by a favorable impact from interest expense and signed leasing backlog. The company has established 2021 operating FFO per share guidance of $0.77 to $0.87, with theater reopening being a key factor in determining earnings. Additionally, RPT plans to deploy $100 million of cash into opportunistic acquisitions. The company remains optimistic about the future, focusing on traditional REIT operating performance measures as the environment normalizes.
