Hilton's third-quarter financial performance demonstrated continued recovery, with systemwide RevPAR up 98.7% year-over-year, driven by strong leisure demand. Despite remaining below 2019 levels, RevPAR reached 85% of 2019 peaks in July and has remained resilient, with 80% of 2019 levels achieved in August and September. Encouragingly, business travel is gaining momentum, with midweek occupancy and rates improving. Group travel remains subdued but is showing signs of recovery, particularly in social events. Hilton has signed nearly 24,000 rooms in the quarter, driven by strength in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions. The company's pipeline continues to grow, with over 400,000 rooms in development and a focus on new development and conversion opportunities. In response to changing guest preferences, Hilton has launched new commercial programs and loyalty extensions, including Digital Key Share and automatic room upgrades for elite members. The company's commitment to providing exceptional guest experiences has been recognized with a third-place ranking on Fortune and Great Place to Work's list of World's Best Workplaces.
