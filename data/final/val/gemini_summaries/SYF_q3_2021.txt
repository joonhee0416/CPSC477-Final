Synchrony's third quarter financial results showcased a strong performance with double-digit purchase volume growth, a 165-basis point increase in net interest margin to 15.45%, and continued low charge-off rates of 2.18%. Despite elevated payment rates, loan growth remained modest at 2%. Synchrony's omnichannel capabilities and data-driven insights led to an increase in active accounts by 5% and new accounts by 17% to 6.2 million. The company also expanded its partnership with Fiserv and PayPal, enabling access to Synchrony products for small businesses and adding a new PayPal savings account. Additionally, Synchrony launched industry-first health and wellness credit cards, leveraging the power of its digital capabilities. The company's strategic investments in cost efficiency resulted in a 10% decrease in operating expenses and a continued reduction in its efficiency ratio. Synchrony's strong financial performance is attributed to its unique model, which leverages consumer lending domain expertise and digital capabilities to reach a diverse customer base. Looking ahead, Synchrony expects stable operating trends in the fourth quarter, driven by strong consumer demand, moderate receivable growth, and a consistent net interest margin. The company remains optimistic about its growth opportunities and plans to continue returning excess capital to shareholders.
