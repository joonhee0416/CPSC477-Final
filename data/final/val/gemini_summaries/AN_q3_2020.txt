AutoNation reported record third-quarter earnings, with adjusted EPS skyrocketing 102% to $2.38. Despite a 1% decline in revenue, strong demand and low inventory fueled a 28% increase in PVRs. Same-store gross profit surged 13%, driven by record margins in new and used vehicles. The company's focus on its "We Will Buy Your Car" initiative resulted in a doubling of sourced vehicles. Cost reduction efforts and increased efficiency through digital capabilities led to an 800 basis point improvement in SG&A, reaching 64.4% of gross profit. AutoNation is aggressively expanding its pre-owned segment with plans to build over 100 AutoNation USA stores, targeting $2.5 million in annual pre-tax profit per store. The company also announced a $500 million share repurchase authorization. Looking ahead, AutoNation anticipates a rebalancing of volume and vehicle margins as inventories recover.
