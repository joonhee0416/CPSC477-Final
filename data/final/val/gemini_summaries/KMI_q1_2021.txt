Kinder Morgan reported strong financial results for the first quarter of 2021, driven by the impact of Winter Storm Uri. The company's revised forecast for full-year 2021 DCF and EBITDA has been substantially upwardly revised, with DCF projected to be between $5.1 billion to $5.3 billion, a significant increase from the original budget of $4.45 billion. Kinder Morgan's natural gas segment performed exceptionally well, particularly its Texas intrastate pipeline and storage network, which benefited from volatile prices during the storm. Additionally, the company's CO2 business contributed to the strong performance, as it shed load to deliver power back to the grid during the storm. Despite the positive impact of the storm, the company anticipates some pandemic-related impacts and lower petroleum products volumes. The dividend was increased to an annualized rate of $1.08 per share, reflecting the company's commitment to returning value to shareholders.
