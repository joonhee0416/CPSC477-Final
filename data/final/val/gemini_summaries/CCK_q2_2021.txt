The company reported a 34% increase in net sales for the quarter, driven by higher volumes, favorable currency translation, and the pass-through of higher material costs. Adjusted earnings per share increased significantly from $1.33 to $2.14, driven by higher sales unit volumes, including a recovery in locations affected by COVID-19. The company expects continued strong demand across product lines and geographies.
