Benchmark Electronics reported Q3 revenue of $526 million, a 7% sequential increase driven by strong demand in defense, semi-cap, and telco sectors. Non-GAAP earnings per share came in at $0.32, despite COVID-related costs of $0.04 per share, reflecting improved operational efficiency. Gross margins rebounded 170 basis points to 8.7% due to higher revenues, increased productivity, and reduced COVID costs. The company anticipates Q4 revenue between $500-$540 million, with gross margins reaching 9-9.1%, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.32-$0.36. Benchmark expects revenue to remain steady in Q4 despite declining medical demand due to the pivot away from COVID-19 therapy devices. However, the company projects strong demand in defense, industrials, and telco sectors, indicating a diverse and growing customer base. Benchmark continues to advance its strategic initiatives, including focusing on customer relationships, selecting the right submarkets, improving operational efficiency, and engaging and developing talent, to drive future growth and value creation.
