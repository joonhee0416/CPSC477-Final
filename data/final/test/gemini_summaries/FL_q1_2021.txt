Foot Locker reported strong financial results for the first quarter, with an 80.3% increase in same-store sales and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.96, up 28.1% from 2019. Despite store closures in Europe and Canada, omnichannel growth and a lack of promotional activity drove exceptional top-line and bottom-line performance. The company saw strong performance in athleisure and fitness apparel, and the closure of Runners Point and the winding down of Footaction over the next two years will allow Foot Locker to focus on its iconic concepts. Foot Locker remains optimistic about its prospects, with strong product tailwinds, an expanded digital platform, and an evolving real estate portfolio. However, the company anticipates a more promotional environment in the second quarter and uncertainty due to the ongoing pandemic.
