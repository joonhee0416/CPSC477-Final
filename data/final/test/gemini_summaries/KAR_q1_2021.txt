During the first quarter of 2021, KAR Global reported a decrease in revenue of 10% to $581.6 million, primarily due to constrained vehicle supply in the wholesale market. Despite these challenges, the company achieved a 39% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $123 million, driven by cost control and increased revenue from purchased vehicles. The company's digital dealer-to-dealer marketplaces, BacklotCars and TradeRev, saw robust growth, with combined sales exceeding 100,000 vehicles, an 81% increase compared to Q1 2020. While supply constraints are expected to continue in the near term, the company remains optimistic about its long-term prospects. Key metrics to monitor in the future include: total vehicles sold, percentage of vehicles sold off-premise, TradeRev and BacklotCars volumes, gross margin per vehicle sold within the ADESA segment, and SG&A per vehicle sold within the ADESA segment.
