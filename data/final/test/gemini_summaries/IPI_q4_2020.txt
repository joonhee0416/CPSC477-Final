Intrepid's fourth quarter saw a surge in demand and pricing for its potash and trio segments, resulting in a significant increase in earnings and EBITDA compared to the previous quarter. The company's full-cycle water management strategy for the Delaware Basin is progressing, with plans for a produced water disposal system and potential partnerships in the oilfield and full cycle water management space. The oilfield segment also experienced improvement, with increased water sales from higher-margin sources. The company's strong cash flow and EBITDA of $9.7 million in Q4 highlighted its financial strength. Intrepid anticipates continued growth in potash and trio sales in the first half of 2021, with potash net realized sales price expected to rise to $300-$310 per ton in the second quarter. Additionally, the company estimates 2021 capital investment of $25-$35 million, with discretion over opportunity capital investments as expectations evolve.
