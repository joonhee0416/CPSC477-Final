Select Medical reported a 6.8% revenue increase in Q4 to $1.56 billion, with growth across all business segments. Notably, critical illness recovery hospitals saw a 7.3% revenue increase, while rehabilitation hospitals and outpatient rehab experienced increases of 10.5% and 7.8%, respectively. Concentra's revenue rose 3% in Q4. However, adjusted EBITDA declined in Q4, primarily due to increased labor costs, especially in critical illness recovery hospitals, where agency nursing rates nearly doubled. Despite these challenges, full-year revenue increased 12.2% to $6.2 billion, and adjusted EBITDA grew 18.3% to $947.4 million, driven by provider relief funds. Select Medical expects revenue between $6.25 billion and $6.4 billion for 2022, reaffirming its revenue growth targets of 4% to 6% for 2021-2023.
