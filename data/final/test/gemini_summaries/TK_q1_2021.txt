In the first quarter of 2021, Teekay Corporation reported an adjusted net income of $11 million (or $0.11 per share), an increase from $3 million (or $0.03 per share) in the previous quarter. Total adjusted EBITDA also rose slightly to $202 million. This growth was driven by strong performances in Teekay's gas shipping, oil shipping, and marine services businesses, despite weakness in the conventional tanker market. While the second quarter is expected to be lower than the first due to scheduled dry docking and the expiration of fixed rate charters, Teekay is making significant progress in winding down its FPSO segment, which is expected to reduce its asset retirement obligations in Q2. Furthermore, Teekay LNG's performance improved slightly, with adjusted net income increasing to $60 million (or $0.61 per unit), and it recently increased its quarterly common unit distribution by 15%. Teekay Tankers reported an adjusted net loss of $22 million (or $0.65 per share), an improvement from the previous quarter. Despite uncertainty in the tanker market due to COVID-19, Teekay Tankers maintains a strong balance sheet and is taking measures to reduce its overall cost of capital. As the world recovers from the pandemic, Teekay anticipates a gradual return to pre-pandemic levels of demand for oil, gas, and related transportation services.
