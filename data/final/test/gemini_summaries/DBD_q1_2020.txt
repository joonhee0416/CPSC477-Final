Earnings for Q1 were in line with expectations, with revenue of $911 million despite COVID-19 headwinds. Stronger gross margins and reduced operating expenses led to a significant increase in operating profit of 133% year-over-year. The company executed incremental cost-saving actions, resulting in an expected $80-$100 million in savings. The services business is expected to experience a mild impact, while product revenue may see a moderate impact due to delayed installations and postponed hardware purchases. Despite these challenges, gross margins are projected to improve due to cost structure adjustments and DN Now initiatives. Targeting breakeven free cash flow for the year, Diebold Nixdorf believes its essential services designation, recurring revenue streams, and operational rigor will allow it to navigate the current environment and emerge as a stronger company. In April, order entry saw a moderate slowdown, while hardware installations were delayed and factories continued to ship high volumes. Services and software revenue remained stable, and employee morale remained high.
