Key Corporation reported a solid first quarter with a 9% increase in diluted earnings per share to $0.61. Revenue growth was driven by fee-based businesses, particularly investment banking and consumer mortgage originations. The acquisition of Laurel Road has accelerated digital transformation and added high-quality loan relationships. Non-interest income rose significantly, offsetting a decline in net interest margin due to the larger balance sheet and excess liquidity. Despite ongoing pandemic challenges, credit quality remains strong, with net charge-offs decreasing to 46 basis points. Key maintains a solid capital position, supported by a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.8%, and continues to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The outlook for 2021 is positive, with expectations for positive operating leverage, modest loan growth, mid-single-digit non-interest income growth, stable expenses, and net charge-offs of 35-45 basis points.
