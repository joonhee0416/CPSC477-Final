Travelers Companies reported strong financial results for the fourth quarter and full year, driven by robust underwriting income and expense efficiency. The company's core income in Q4 reached $1.3 billion ($4.91 per diluted share), reflecting a significant increase from the prior year. Net written premiums grew by 3% for the quarter and 2% for the full year, with record levels in Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance. Notably, the company's expense ratio remained below 30% for both the quarter and the full year, highlighting its ongoing focus on productivity and efficiency. Despite challenges posed by the pandemic and other factors, Travelers' strong underlying underwriting income, favorable prior year reserve development, and disciplined expense management contributed to an 11.3% core return on equity for the full year. The company's strategy to generate profitable growth through segmentation, pricing, and investments in technology and customer service continues to drive its success and position it well for the future.
