Jabil reported strong Q1 results with $400 million in core operating income and revenue of $8.6 billion, driven by strength in healthcare, industrial, semi cap, and mobility markets.

Despite the challenges, Jabil's team and their tools helped them maximize allocations and keep factories running. For Q2, the company anticipates revenue between $7.1 billion and $7.7 billion and core diluted earnings per share between $1.35 and $1.55. Jabil's outlook for FY22 is positive, with revenue now projected at $31.8 billion and core earnings per share increasing to $6.55. The company remains focused on driving growth through secular trends in healthcare, automotive, cloud, semi-cap, and clean energy markets.
