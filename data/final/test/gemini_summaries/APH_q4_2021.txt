In its fourth quarter, Amphenol achieved record sales of $3.027 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.70, exceeding guidance and setting new quarterly highs. Organic sales growth was 18%, with robust growth in key markets such as IT, data communications, industrial, and automotive. Full-year sales reached $10.876 billion, marking a 18% organic growth rate. Order bookings were also strong at $3.278 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.08:1.

Despite challenges in supply chain and commodity costs, Amphenol maintained a strong operating margin of 20.1% in the fourth quarter, supported by operating leverage and other cost-saving measures. Full-year adjusted operating margin was 20%, a significant increase over the prior year.

The company's diversified end-market strategy continues to mitigate risk. The industrial market, the largest, grew by 25% in the fourth quarter and 46% for the full year.

The IT and data communications market remained strong, with a 22% growth rate in the fourth quarter and a 24% growth rate for the full year.

Amphenol's acquisition program has also contributed to growth. During the fourth quarter, the company acquired Halo Technology Limited, a provider of fiber optic interconnect components, which is expected to enhance Amphenol's position in high-growth markets.

For the first quarter of 2022, Amphenol expects sales in the range of $2.690 billion to $2.750 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.59 to $0.61, representing strong growth over the prior year.
