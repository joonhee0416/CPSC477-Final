H&R Block reported a 54% decline in Q1 revenue due to a prior-year tax season extension. However, excluding this impact, the company saw growth in Emerald Card revenue from child tax payments and continued growth in Wave. Expenses were managed effectively with cost savings offsetting investments in growth initiatives. Adjusted loss per share was $0.78, but the company emphasized the long-term value it has created. Since 2016, H&R Block has increased free cash flow by 29%, grown dividends by 35%, and repurchased nearly 25% of shares outstanding, leading to a 78% increase in adjusted EPS. The company is confident in its Block Horizons plan, which aims for 3%-6% annual revenue growth through industry growth, pricing adjustments, franchise acquisitions, and its strategic imperatives of Block Experience, Small Business, and Financial Products. H&R Block believes it has reduced its risk profile and created growth levers, but its valuation remains compressed despite strong earnings growth. The company remains committed to its disciplined capital allocation approach and is excited about the opportunities ahead.
