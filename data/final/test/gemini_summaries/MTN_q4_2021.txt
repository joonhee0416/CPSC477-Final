**Vail Resorts Reports Robust Performance with Strong Pass Product Sales and Planned Capital Investments**

For fiscal 2021, Vail Resorts reported a net income of $127.9 million, driven by cost controls and strong pass product sales. Despite challenges like COVID-19 and early resort closures, the company saw improved results in its North American ski season, with a 6% decline in skier visitation compared to pre-pandemic levels.

Pass product sales exceeded expectations for the upcoming season, growing 42% in units and 17% in sales dollars through September 17, 2021, supported by price reductions and increased guest affinity for outdoor experiences.

Vail Resorts forecasts a net income of $278 million to $349 million for fiscal 2022, with an estimated Resort reported EBITDA of $785 million to $835 million. The company plans to invest significantly in guest experience, including lift capacity expansions and enhancements at its resorts. A $315 million to $325 million capital plan for calendar year 2022 includes 19 new or replacement lifts and a major terrain expansion at Keystone, expected to enhance guest capacity and circulation. Despite COVID-19's continued impact, particularly in Australia, Vail Resorts remains optimistic about its long-term growth and plans to exit the temporary waiver period under the Vail Holdings Credit Agreement and declare a cash dividend of $0.88 per share.
