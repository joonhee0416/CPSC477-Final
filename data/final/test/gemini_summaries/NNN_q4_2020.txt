2020 marked the 31st consecutive year of dividend increases for National Retail Properties (NNP), a rare feat among U.S. public companies. Despite the pandemic's impact, NNP maintained a high occupancy rate of 98.5%, collected 95.7% of rents due in Q4, and has been actively acquiring new properties with a focus on long-term leases. NNP's balance sheet remains strong, with $267 million in cash and zero debt drawn on its $900 million line of credit. For 2021, NNP projects core FFO per share of $2.55 to $2.62, reflecting continued rent collection improvements and a conservative outlook amid ongoing economic uncertainties. The company plans to continue its long-term strategy, emphasizing single-tenant retail properties, a diversified portfolio, a strong balance sheet, and relationship-oriented acquisitions. NNP's consistent focus on these drivers has positioned it to outperform REIT averages on a multiyear basis.
