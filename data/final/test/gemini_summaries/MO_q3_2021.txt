Altria performed well in Q3 despite challenging comparisons and unfavorable trade inventory movement, with adjusted diluted earnings per share increasing 2.5% and adjusted operating company income growing 2.6% for the first nine months. Smokeable products continue to generate significant cash, while oral tobacco products deliver strong margins. The on! nicotine pouch portfolio experienced significant retail share growth, reaching 3 share points in Q3. In e-vapor, total category volume increased 17% year-over-year, but the future of e-vapor remains uncertain pending PMTA decisions. Heated tobacco volume grew in markets where IQOS is available, with Marlboro HeatSticks achieving a 1.8% retail share in Northern Virginia. However, the ITC recently imposed an importation ban on IQOS, which Altria views as detrimental to public health and is currently under review by the USTR. Despite this setback, Altria remains committed to the heated tobacco category and the pursuit of its vision of transitioning smokers to a smoke-free future. Altria raised the lower end of its full-year 2021 guidance, now expecting adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 5% to 6%.
