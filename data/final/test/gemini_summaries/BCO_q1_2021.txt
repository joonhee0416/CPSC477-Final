Brink's reported strong first-quarter results, driven by successful G4S acquisition integrations and fixed cost reductions. Revenue grew 12%, operating profit increased 43%, adjusted EBITDA rose 32%, and earnings per share surged 64%. Despite the pandemic's impact on the prior year's results, organic revenue was down only 6% this quarter, while operating profit increased 30%, indicating continued recovery. The company expects revenue and profit growth to accelerate in the second half of 2021, supported by continued economic recovery and full-year benefits from acquisitions. Brink's completed the final phase of the G4S acquisition and recently purchased PAI for $213 million. Together, these acquisitions are expected to contribute approximately $130 million in adjusted EBITDA this year. They are also increasing their 2021 guidance to over $700 million in EBITDA and $5 per share earnings. The company has a strong strategic plan with a focus on organic growth, acquisitions, and digital cash initiatives. SP2 includes 1.0 initiatives for cost reductions, 1.5 for acquisitions, and 2.0 for digital cash solutions. Digital cash management solutions aim to provide complete digital-focused solutions for the cash ecosystem. Brink's has entered into a cross-currency swap, which should reduce 2021 interest expense and increase earnings per share. Their free cash flow target for 2021 is between $185 million and $275 million, with a midpoint of $230 million. The company has ample liquidity of $1.4 billion and expects to reduce leverage by up to a half a turn to a midpoint total leverage ratio of about 3.0 turns. Brink's plans to host an Investor Day in October to provide more details on their three-year strategic plan and present financial targets.
