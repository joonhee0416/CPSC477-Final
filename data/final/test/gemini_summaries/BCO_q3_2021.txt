Brink's reported strong third-quarter results, exceeding analyst consensus and guidance. Revenue grew 11%, with 6% organic growth, while operating profit increased by 16%. Despite operational challenges, the company increased its operating profit margin by 50 basis points to 10.8%. Brink's is affirming its 2021 guidance, including revenue between $4.1 billion and $4.2 billion, operating profit of $465 million, and adjusted EBITDA of $660 million. The company also affirmed its preliminary 2022 adjusted EBIT target range of $785 to $825 million. Furthermore, management expects continued revenue improvement in 2022 driven by organic growth, higher price increases offsetting wage inflation, and contributions from digital solutions. This is expected to exceed 100% of pre-COVID revenue levels, resulting in an adjusted EBITDA target of $755 million. The company also announced a $150 million share repurchase agreement, which will be substantially completed by early November. Finally, Brink's plans to host an Investor Day on December 15 to discuss its Strategy 2.0 initiatives and digital cash management solutions.
