Despite supply chain challenges, the company executed well and implemented pricing actions to offset cost increases. Organic growth was strong across all segments, with Automotive OEM rebounding at 84%. The outlook for full-year organic growth was raised to 11-13%, and earnings estimates were increased to $8.55-$8.95 per share, including a one-time tax benefit. Price/cost headwinds are expected to modestly impact margins in Q3, but the company expects to offset these with volume leverage and enterprise initiatives. Free cash flow conversion remains strong at 100% of net income, and share repurchases are expected to continue.
