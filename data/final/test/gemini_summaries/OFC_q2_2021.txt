Strong Q2 results with FFO per share exceeding guidance, driven by same property performance. Same property NOI increased 8% and AFFO grew 17% year-over-year. Leasing activity remained robust, with 1.7 million square feet leased year-to-date, including significant development leasing. The company remains confident in achieving its 1 million square foot leasing target for the year. Despite the expected vacancy of a building at Redstone Gateway, demand for space remains strong, with multiple contractors interested in the site. Accelerated development completions, including Project EL and NoVA C, are contributing to the increased FFO guidance of $2.26 per share, an increase of 0.1% and 6.6% higher than 2020 results. The company's strategy of investing near Defense Department missions and undertaking low-risk developments is proving successful, resulting in consistent earnings growth and lower capital costs.
