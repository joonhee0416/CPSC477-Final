In the second quarter of 2020, U.S. Cellular and TDS reported solid results amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. U.S. Cellular witnessed a downturn in gross handset additions due to reduced store traffic and mobile switching activity, but experienced a surge in connected device additions driven by increased demand for remote connectivity. The company's postpaid churn rate remained low, contributing to a rise in postpaid revenue per user. U.S. Cellular emphasized its commitment to network modernization, including its expansion of 5G service to 11 additional states. TDS reported an increase in consolidated revenues primarily due to the acquisition of a cable company last year and growth in broadband and video subscribers. The company's fiber deployment program continues to expand, with approximately 33% of wireline serviced addresses now served by fiber. TDS's wireline adjusted EBITDA decreased due to declines in commercial and wholesale revenues, while cable adjusted EBITDA rose 20%. Overall, both U.S. Cellular and TDS expressed confidence in their strategic priorities and financial objectives for the remainder of the year.
