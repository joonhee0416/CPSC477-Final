Valmont's first quarter results exhibited strong performance driven by favorable market conditions and effective execution. Net sales increased by 14.9% to $774.9 million, primarily due to higher sales in Irrigation and Utility Support Structure segments. Earnings per share grew by 29.1% to $2.57, driven by higher operating income and a favorable tax rate. Despite inflationary pressures, the company's disciplined pricing strategies and operational efficiencies mitigated the impact, resulting in operating income margins of 10%. Valmont's backlog remains at a record $1.3 billion, providing visibility for future growth. For the second quarter, the company projects sales between $805 million and $830 million, with operating income margins ranging from 9.5% to 10.5%. The full-year outlook is reaffirmed, with net sales growth estimated at 9% to 14% and earnings per share expected between $9 and $9.70. Management remains focused on profitable growth and return on invested capital improvement, while investing in strategic growth initiatives.
