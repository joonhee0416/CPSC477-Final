Watts Industries' Q2 performance exceeded expectations, driven by strong economic recovery, rising demand for repair and replacements, and the impact of a February weather freeze. The company reported a 38% increase in sales to $467 million, with organic growth of 32%. Adjusted operating profit surged 85%, expanding margins by 3.8 percentage points to 14.9%. Increased volume, price adjustments, and cost-cutting initiatives contributed to this profitability. The company has increased its full-year outlook, citing improved market conditions and a third price increase in the Americas. Smart and connected product sales continue to increase, and sustainability remains a key focus. Despite supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures, Watts remains optimistic about the future based on positive GDP expectations and strong residential and repair/replacement markets.
