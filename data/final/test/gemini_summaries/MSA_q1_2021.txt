Despite a challenging start to 2021 with a 10% decline in revenue due to economic conditions and COVID-19 impacts, MSA Safety (MSA) is optimistic about its future based on three key areas. Firstly, MSA's innovation engine remains strong, highlighted by the launch of the LUNAR firefighter location system and the expansion of connected gas detection capabilities in industrial markets. Secondly, the continuous improvement culture is positioning the company for long-term success through initiatives like the gas detection manufacturing consolidation project. Thirdly, the company is effectively utilizing its balance sheet to pursue strategic acquisitions, as evidenced by the recent acquisition of Bristol Uniforms. MSA's order pace strengthened in March and April, with industrial markets showing year-over-year growth, providing momentum heading into Q2. The company is also closely managing its cost structure and expects to deliver on its committed cost savings for 2021. While near-term supply chain challenges may impact revenue performance, improving demand levels and strong market positions provide optimism for the second quarter and beyond. MSA's long-term focus areas are expected to drive success as conditions continue to improve.
