In its first quarter, the company experienced 24% revenue growth driven by consumer demand and cost-based pricing actions. The record 12.4% ongoing EBIT margin was achieved through 575 basis points of margin expansion from price-mix and 375 basis points from net cost reduction, partially offset by raw material inflation and marketing investments. Despite supply chain constraints and rising input costs, the company raised its full-year guidance for net sales growth to 13%, EBIT margin to 10%, and earnings per share to $22.50-$23.50, a 25% year-over-year increase. The company remains confident in its ability to navigate market challenges, protect margins, and generate strong free cash flow of $1.25 billion. It also increased its dividend for the ninth consecutive year and authorized an additional $2 billion in share buybacks. Overall, the company's financial performance and strategic initiatives demonstrate its strength and commitment to delivering shareholder value.
