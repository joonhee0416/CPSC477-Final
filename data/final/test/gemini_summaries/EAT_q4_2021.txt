Brinker International's fourth quarter marked a strong finish to fiscal year 2021, with revenue reaching $1.009 billion and a consolidated comp sales growth of 65%. Driven primarily by increased traffic, Chili's reported a record $900 million in quarterly revenue, exceeding pre-pandemic levels. Maggiano's made solid progress in its recovery curve, laying the groundwork for continued growth in fiscal year 2022. The restaurant operating margin reached 16.9%, significantly improving from pre-COVID levels. While food and beverage expenses rose due to commodity costs, labor expenses were favorable due to extra week sales leverage and slower reopening in high-wage states. The company invested in its team members and managers through bonus structures, resulting in a modest increase in labor expense margin. Despite a higher tax rate, Brinker's operating cash flow remained strong, contributing to a $300 million share repurchase authorization. The company expects mid-single-digit inflation for commodities and labor in fiscal year 2022 and plans to allocate $155 million to $165 million in capital expenditures. With a strong team and diverse brand portfolio, Brinker is confident in its ability to navigate the ongoing challenges and continue delivering quality results in the future.
