Digital Realty had a strong financial performance in Q4, exceeding the high end of its guidance range with $156 million in new bookings, led by record results in both sub-1 megawatt and greater than 1 megawatt categories. This contributed to $500 million in new bookings for the year, a 15% increase. The company also strengthened its global platform with the completion of organic development projects and strategic investments, establishing Digital Realty as the leading pan-African provider through the acquisition of Teraco. Teraco's facilities complement Digital Realty's existing investments in Africa and further enhance its highly connected PlatformDIGITAL, supporting customers' growth. Additionally, Digital Realty's Digital Core REIT offering was well-received, raising over $950 million and establishing a perpetual capital partner for the company. The company expects to contribute more stabilized core assets to Digital Core REIT in the future. Despite a 60-basis point decline in portfolio occupancy due to development deliveries, Digital Realty's financial performance was solid, with a 4% year-over-year increase in core FFO per share to $2.03 and a full-year core FFO per share of $6.85, excluding certain fees. Looking ahead to 2022, the company anticipates core FFO per share between $6.80 and $6.90, including dilution from Teraco and FX headwinds. Revenue is projected in the range of $4.7 billion to $4.8 billion, with adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2.5 billion. Digital Realty remains committed to its sustainable business practices and has incorporated a sustainability-linked pricing component into its credit facility, emphasizing its dedication to minimizing environmental impact.
