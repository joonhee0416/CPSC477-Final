DHI, the company behind career marketplaces Dice, ClearanceJobs, and eFinancialCareers, reported a 9% year-over-year revenue decline in Q2 2020 due to the impact of COVID-19. Dice, which contributes most to DHI's revenue, experienced a 12% annual revenue decrease despite a stable number of tech job postings and progress in landing larger clients. ClearanceJobs continued its double-digit revenue growth due to its connection to the stable U.S. Defense budget. eFinancialCareers faced challenges in its largest markets (the U.K. and APAC) due to COVID and geopolitical issues. Despite these challenges, DHI believes its focus on building career marketplaces for matching tech professionals with employers positions it well for growth in the coming years, as the demand for technologists is projected to surge. The company is executing on its plan to transform Dice into a full-scale career marketplace, having launched new features like Dice Recruiter Profile, Dice Remote Jobs, and enhancements to eFinancialCareers' candidate profile and communication tools. The company's sales team has also seen success in securing more commercial accounts. DHI remains focused on cost management, having reduced non-headcount-related expenses to maintain its 20% adjusted EBITDA margin target.
