Webster Bank reported a first-quarter 2020 earnings per share of $0.39, impacted by increased provision for credit losses stemming from CECL adoption and the weakened forward economic outlook due to COVID-19. Nevertheless, the bank's overall financial position remains strong, with a 4.75% return on common equity and 5.95% return on tangible common equity despite the $68 million reserve build in the quarter. The bank has focused on risk management and strategic shifts, including de-emphasizing sectors highly impacted by the pandemic. Loan growth was driven by commercial loans, while residential mortgage and home equity loans performed well. Deposits increased due to HSA deposits and public funds. The bank has implemented various measures to support customers and communities during the pandemic, such as loan modifications, fee waivers, and donations to organizations addressing urgent basic needs. Webster Bank's capital position remains strong, and it does not anticipate repurchasing additional shares until the pandemic subsides.
