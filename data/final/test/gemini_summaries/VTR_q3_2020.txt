Ventas, Inc. reported $0.75 normalized FFO per share in Q3 2020, driven by stable medical office and research and innovation performance. The company's diversified portfolio, including healthcare triple-net lease and senior housing, has mitigated the pandemic's impact. Senior housing continues to improve, with net positive move-ins in October, and operators successfully implementing COVID-19 protocols. Ventas has invested in high-growth life science markets, including a $1 billion trophy portfolio in South San Francisco and a $280 million development in Philadelphia. The company has also expanded its third-party institutional capital management platform, securing a $2 billion joint venture with GIC for research and innovation projects. Ventas remains committed to the senior housing business despite near-term uncertainty, as demand for need-driven senior housing remains strong. The company's office portfolio, including MOBs and research centers, has performed well, with 99% of tenants paying contractual rent in Q3. Ventas is actively managing its balance sheet, with ample liquidity and access to diversified capital sources.
