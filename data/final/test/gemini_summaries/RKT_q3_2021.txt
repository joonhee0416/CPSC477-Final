Rocket Companies reported strong Q3 financial results, driven by record closed loan volume of $88 billion from its Rocket Mortgage business. The company's platform continues to grow across its businesses, with emerging sectors like Rocket Homes and Rocket Auto reaching new milestones. Rocket Mortgage continues to gain market share, exceeding 10% in a purchase-heavy market, with a focus on speed, certainty, and choice for clients. The company has partnered with Salesforce to launch a Mortgage-as-a-Service model, expanding its reach to third-party financial institutions and opening up a significant new market opportunity. Rocket Companies remains committed to investing in its platform, particularly in technology, to drive further growth and strengthen its competitive position. The company's strong cash flow and liquidity position allows for strategic capital allocation, including potential acquisitions and share repurchases. Despite a changing interest rate environment, the company expects continued growth in 2022 across its mortgage, real estate, auto, personal loan, and solar businesses.
