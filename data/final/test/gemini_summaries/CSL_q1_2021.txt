Carlisle's first quarter results were mixed, with revenue remaining flat year-over-year despite strong growth in CCM, CFT, and CBF. Revenue decline in CIT, due to ongoing commercial aerospace market disruptions, offset the gains in other segments. Adjusted EBITDA margin declined 180 basis points to 14.4%, primarily due to lower volumes and higher costs. The company anticipates low double-digit growth for 2021 driven by positive momentum in CCM, CFT, and CBF. CIT revenue is expected to decline in the mid-to-high single-digit range due to ongoing headwinds in the aerospace market. Overall, the company's strong financial foundation, cash-generating capabilities, and commitment to Vision 2025 provide confidence in Carlisle's outlook despite the ongoing uncertainties surrounding the pandemic. Additionally, Carlisle Brake & Friction is projected to experience revenue growth of over 30%.
