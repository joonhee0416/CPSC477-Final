In Q1 2021, Hexcel reported $310 million in sales, in line with expectations. Adjusted EPS was negative $0.10, reflecting lower sales. Despite the challenges, Hexcel's team has optimized operations, resulting in significant cost savings and an 8% adjusted operating margin in the Constant Materials segment. Destocking in Commercial Aerospace is expected to wind down by Q2, aligning with OEM production levels. The Space and Defense segment remains stable, with expected growth throughout the year. Industrial sales declined due to weak wind energy demand, but Hexcel is optimistic about recovery. Strong incremental margins are anticipated as sales recover, and the company aims to exceed prior peak margins when sales reach $1.8-$1.9 billion. Overall, Hexcel's financial results demonstrate resilience and a focus on operational excellence, positioning them for growth when the industry recovers.
