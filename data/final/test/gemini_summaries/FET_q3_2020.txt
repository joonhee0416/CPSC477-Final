Despite a 9% sequential revenue decline in Q3 due to a 70% year-over-year drop in U.S. drilling rig count, Forum maintained positive free cash flow and improved EBITDA through cost cuts. The company expects strong revenue growth in Q4 driven by increased orders in Q3, particularly in subsea and artificial lift products. Forum anticipates impressive incremental margins in Q4, exceeding 35%. The company has made significant progress in reducing its cost structure, with annualized cash costs down nearly 50%, leading to a reduced breakeven EBITDA level of around 325 active U.S. rigs. Forum has also improved its capital structure, extending the maturity of its bonds and eliminating $13 million of 2021 notes. These measures position Forum to benefit from the ongoing recovery in drilling and completions activity.
