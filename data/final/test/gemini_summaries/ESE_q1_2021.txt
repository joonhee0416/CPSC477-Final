ESCO Technologies reported strong adjusted earnings per share of $0.55 in Q1, exceeding estimates and increasing by 28% from the previous year. Despite lower A&D sales due to COVID's impact on commercial aerospace, strong performance in other segments offset this headwind. Navy business remained stable, Test business outperformed with increased margins, and USG's cost reduction measures resulted in a significant EBITDA margin improvement. The company's strong liquidity position and cash flow generation, with a 127% conversion ratio, supports its focus on maintaining financial stability during the pandemic. While COVID-related uncertainty persists, the company anticipates a stronger second half of 2021 as vaccine rollouts progress and end markets stabilize. Despite a slight decline expected in the first half compared to 2020, ESCO's adjusted EBITDA and earnings per share are projected to align with 2019 levels, with potential growth resulting from any additional acquisitions. M&A opportunities continue to be evaluated, and the integration of the recent ATM acquisition is on track. Overall, ESCO is optimistic about its long-term success due to its market leadership, unique solutions, and disciplined approach to business operations.
