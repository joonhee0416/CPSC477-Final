Regions Bank reported a solid first quarter, kicking off 2021 on a positive note. Despite the ongoing pandemic, the bank's credit metrics continue to improve, and they reduced their allowance for credit losses by $142 million. Customer conversations indicate optimism about economic recovery, supported by vaccine distribution and business reopenings. The bank's ongoing focus is on deepening customer relationships and providing personalized financial guidance.

Loan growth is expected to be impacted by excess liquidity in the market, but the bank expects adjusted ending loans to grow in the low single digits. Deposit balances continued to increase to new record levels, driven by consumer growth and government stimulus payments. Net interest income decreased due to lower loan balances and remixing out of higher yielding loan categories, but the normalized net interest margin remained stable at 3.40%.

Adjusted non-interest income decreased slightly but remains above pre-pandemic levels. Capital markets and mortgage continue to perform well, but service charges remain impacted by changes in customer behavior. Adjusted non-interest expenses decreased, driven by lower incentive compensation, partially offset by seasonal payroll tax increases.

Overall credit quality remains strong, with net charge-offs improving to 40 basis points. The bank maintains a high allowance for credit losses at 2.44% of total loans. Based on current expectations, they anticipate full-year net charge-offs to range from 40 basis points to 50 basis points. Capital ratios remain robust, and the bank plans to begin share repurchases in the second quarter, subject to earnings-based restrictions. Overall, the bank is optimistic about the economic recovery, with momentum expected to continue throughout the year.
