Overall, Sysco's financial position remains strong, with $5.8 billion in cash on hand and $2 billion in available borrowing capacity. While Q3 results are expected to be challenging due to ongoing COVID-19 restrictions, Sysco is confident in its ability to accelerate long-term growth through its transformation initiatives and customer-centric approach.
