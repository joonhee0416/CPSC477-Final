Linde has recorded another successful quarter, reporting record earnings per share amidst challenging market conditions. Operating cash flow and return on capital reached all-time highs, and the project backlog has nearly doubled, securing long-term growth.

The company has also strengthened its commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, setting ambitious targets to achieve a 35% reduction in Scope one and two emissions by 2035, and ultimately becoming climate-neutral by 2050.

Financially, Linde's sales rose 12% year-over-year, with underlying sales growth excluding cost pass-through reaching 11%. Volume increases were broad-based across geographies and end markets, with pricing levels increasing slightly. Operating margin was 23.6%, showing progress despite recovery costs. EPS rose 27% due to higher volumes and pricing.

Linde generated a record $2.6 billion in operating cash flow, driven by stronger earnings and timing benefits. The company has allocated cash to business investments and shareholder returns through dividends and stock repurchases. The company also raised nearly EUR 2 billion in low-cost debt, ensuring a high degree of confidence in maintaining its shareholder-friendly policies.

For the fourth quarter, EPS guidance is projected to range from $2.60 to $2.70, representing a 13% to 17% increase year-over-year.
