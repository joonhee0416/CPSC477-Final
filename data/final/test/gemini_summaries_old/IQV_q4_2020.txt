IQVIA delivered a strong fourth quarter with double-digit growth in key financial metrics, despite a robust fourth quarter in 2019. The company's Technology & Analytics Solutions (TAS) and Research & Development Solutions (R&DS) segments drove the growth with mid-teens revenue increases. R&DS backlog surged 18.5% year-over-year to $22.6 billion, providing visibility for future revenue. IQVIA's full-year 2021 guidance increased for revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS), with expected revenue growth of at least 9% and adjusted EPS growth of over 20%. The company also expects margin expansion and further net leverage reduction. For the first quarter, IQVIA anticipates revenue between $3,150 million and $3,200 million and adjusted EPS within the range of $1.81 and $1.87. These positive results reflect the company's successful navigation of the pandemic, strong client demand, and continued investments in technology and data capabilities.
