Annaly Capital Management recently reported solid second-quarter results, with core earnings well above its dividend. The company has taken several strategic initiatives, including internalizing operations and appointing a new COO. They have also been actively repurchasing their undervalued stock. Despite the economic slowdown, Annaly's measured approach to managing the crisis has paid off.

In the agency market, the Fed's aggressive MBS purchases have improved liquidity and asset pricing. Annaly increased its TBA position and gravitated to lower coupons, resulting in improved returns. They also reduced their LIBOR footprint and re-initiated a short position in treasury futures.

Residential credit has experienced significant recovery, indicating that forbearance cases are being resolved. Securitization markets are showing signs of life, and Annaly issued expanded prime securities. Commercial real estate activity is slowly picking up, with increased refinancing requests and new acquisition activity. However, hospitality and retail sectors remain challenged.

Middle market lending has seen increased activity, with tightening spreads and new deal execution. Annaly remains focused on performance monitoring and maintaining a stable and defensive portfolio. Despite taking a conservative approach to reserves, they are confident in the portfolio's ability to withstand volatility.

Annaly anticipates increasing its allocation to agency MBS while also evaluating opportunities in its other credit businesses. They have been conservative with leverage and dividends, focusing on optimal liquidity thresholds and quality earnings. As the operating environment improves, the company expects to deliver compelling returns across its businesses.
