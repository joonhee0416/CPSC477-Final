Teleflex's third-quarter performance reflected an improving trend across several global product categories, led by a faster-than-expected recovery in their Interventional Urology business and continued strength in vascular access product sales. Overall revenue of $628.3 million was down 4.1% on a constant currency basis but exceeded estimates. Excluding the estimated $78 million negative impact of COVID-19, Teleflex estimates an underlying business growth of approximately 8%. Adjusted earnings per share of $2.77 exceeded expectations and were ahead of internal forecasts. Significant sequential improvements in adjusted gross and operating margins were observed compared to the second quarter. Teleflex also announced the acquisition of Z-Medica, a leading hemostatic product manufacturer, for $500 million upfront and up to an additional $25 million in milestones, expected to be completed in Q4 and contribute $60-70 million in revenue in 2021. For the fourth quarter, Teleflex expects a modest improvement in constant currency revenue performance compared to Q3, excluding the impact of additional selling days and the Z-Medica acquisition.
