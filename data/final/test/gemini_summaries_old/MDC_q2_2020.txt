MDC Holdings reported strong earnings for the second quarter, driven by a rebound in order activity and increased home sale revenues. The company's build-to-order business model proved to be successful, resulting in higher-margin revenues and a lower need for discounts. Strong demand trends were broad-based, with particularly strong demand for affordable housing. Additionally, the company benefited from market share gains against the existing home market. MDC demonstrated solid operating leverage, with SG&A expenses decreasing as a percentage of home sale revenues. Despite the pandemic's initial impact, net orders increased 5% for the quarter, with June net new home orders increasing 53% year-over-year. Favorable market conditions, including low interest rates and a constrained existing home supply, are expected to continue providing tailwinds for demand. MDC increased its home delivery target for 2020 to 8,000, reflecting the strong performance and favorable market outlook. The company's financial position remains strong, providing flexibility for continued investment and dividend payments.
