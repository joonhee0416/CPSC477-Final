In the fourth quarter of 2020, Discover Financial Services reported net income of $799 million, or $2.59 per share, exceeding estimates despite a 4% year-over-year revenue decline. Excluding one-time expenses, earnings per share would have been $2.94. Despite pandemic challenges, Discover's digital banking model and conservative credit management resulted in a 30% return on equity in the fourth quarter. Total loans decreased 6% year-over-year, primarily due to elevated payment rates and promotional rate reductions. However, Discover gained market share in private student lending and card lending. Net interest margin expanded to 10.63%, driven by lower deposit and funding costs. The company remains committed to expense management while investing in growth and efficiency initiatives. The allowance for credit losses held steady, reflecting improved credit performance in all lending products. As economic recovery progresses, Discover anticipates credit deterioration in the second half of 2021. The company's Board of Directors has approved a $1.1 billion share repurchase plan, subject to Federal Reserve limitations.
