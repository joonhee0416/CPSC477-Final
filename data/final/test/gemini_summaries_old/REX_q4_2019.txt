Sales increased by 6.7% in Q4 primarily due to higher ethanol pricing, but volumes declined. Despite improved crush spreads early in Q4, gross profit for the ethanol and byproducts segment decreased due to declining spreads as the quarter progressed. Ethanol operations are currently running at a loss due to low prices, low demand, and disruptions caused by COVID-19. The refined coal segment also contributed to reduced revenues due to lower demand and coal prices. However, the company recorded an income from its unconsolidated equity investment and a tax benefit, resulting in a net income increase of $4.4 million and diluted EPS of $0.70 in Q4. The company has suspended operations at one ethanol plant and is evaluating similar steps for another due to the challenging market and COVID-19 concerns. Despite these challenges, the company's strong cash position of $205 million provides opportunities for potential buybacks, carbon capture initiatives, and other business pivots. Management acknowledges the severe challenges in the ethanol industry but remains confident in their ability to navigate the situation with their experienced team and resources.
