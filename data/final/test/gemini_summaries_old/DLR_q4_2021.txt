Digital Realty's fourth quarter results were solid, with full year earnings exceeding initial guidance. The company generated $156 million in new bookings, including record performance in both zero to 1 megawatt and above 1 megawatt categories, resulting in a 15% increase in total bookings for the year. Digital Realty also strengthened its global platform by completing development projects across multiple metros and making strategic investments, including the acquisition of Teraco in Africa, establishing the company as the leading colocation provider on the continent. Financially, Digital Realty had a strong quarter with a 4% year-over-year increase in core FFO per share, driven by operational execution, cost controls, and reduced financing costs. Looking ahead, the company anticipates continued growth in 2022 with core FFO per share projected between $6.80 and $6.90, despite expected FX headwinds due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. Digital Realty remains focused on its commitment to sustainability, earning multiple awards and incorporating a sustainability-linked pricing component into its credit facility. The company's strong balance sheet and diverse funding options provide a solid foundation for future growth and capital recycling opportunities.
