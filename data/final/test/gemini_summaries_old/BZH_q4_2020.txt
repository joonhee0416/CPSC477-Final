Despite facing pandemic challenges, the company posted impressive results for fiscal 2020, exceeding its strategic goals. Notably, adjusted EBITDA grew by over 10% due to product simplification and price improvements. The company's focus on debt reduction resulted in a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio below five times. Entering 2021, the company's backlog is up 50%, supporting its confidence in future growth. The supportive market environment, coupled with a newly expanded liquidity position, has led the company to shift its capital allocation strategy towards growth. This shift will involve increasing lot position and reinvesting all of its cash generated from operations. For the first quarter of fiscal 2021, the company expects slightly higher EBITDA, double-digit earnings-per-share growth, and a gross margin of 21.5%. Despite anticipated headwinds, such as higher lumber prices, the company remains optimistic about its long-term growth prospects.
