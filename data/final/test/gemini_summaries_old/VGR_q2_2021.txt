Vector Group reported a strong second quarter, with consolidated revenues reaching $729.5 million, a significant increase of $283.8 million attributed to growth in both the Real Estate and Tobacco segments. Net income surged to $93.3 million or $0.61 per diluted common share, compared to $25.8 million or $0.16 per share in Q2 2020. The company's financial performance remained solid with ample cash and cash equivalents of $490 million.

Douglas Elliman, Vector Group's real estate division, posted impressive results, with revenues doubling to $392 million and record net income of $43.2 million in Q2 2021. The strong momentum in the real estate market, particularly in South Florida and New York City, contributed to this growth.

Liggett, Vector Group's tobacco subsidiary, also performed well, delivering a 30% increase in earnings to $103.2 million due to higher gross margins and effective cost management. The company's earnings growth strategy, including price increases and expansion of its Montego brand, has led to increased market share in the deep discount segment.

Overall, Vector Group's solid financial performance and strong position in real estate and tobacco markets have enabled it to increase its dividends consistently, which is expected to continue in the future.
