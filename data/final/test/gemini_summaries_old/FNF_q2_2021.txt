FNF witnessed significant growth in its second quarter, driven by record-breaking title and F&G performances. Title business produced record pre-tax margins of $688 million, an 82% increase over Q2 2020, due to low interest rates, high demand, and commercial real estate rebound. F&G surpassed expectations with record retail annuity sales and institutional channel expansion, validating FNF's acquisition strategy. The company's earnings strategy, focused on diversifying premium sources and leveraging scale, has doubled F&G's assets under management. This diversification strategy aims to counterbalance FNF's interest rate sensitivity and generate more stable earnings. FNF's total revenue surged to $3.9 billion, with title and F&G segments contributing significantly. Excluding recognized gains and losses, revenue reached $3.6 billion, representing a substantial increase from $2.3 billion in Q2 2020. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations amounted to $592 million, or $2.06 per diluted share. These results highlight the company's commitment to value creation for shareholders, as evidenced by its increased quarterly cash dividend and share repurchase program. FNF remains optimistic about continued strong commercial performance and the potential benefits of its investments in technology, automation, and customer experience enhancements.
