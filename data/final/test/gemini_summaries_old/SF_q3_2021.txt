Stifel Financial reported a strong third quarter with record revenue and earnings per share, driven by organic growth and successful acquisitions. Total revenue increased 30% year-over-year to $1.15 billion, with growth in both Global Wealth Management and Institutional segments. Increased client activity, interest-earning asset growth, and a robust recruiting pipeline contributed to Global Wealth Management's record revenue. Institutional revenue benefited from increased advisory activity and capital raising. The firm's disciplined expense management and focus on returns resulted in a non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.65, up 56% year-over-year. Stifel maintains a strong balance sheet with an increased risk-based capital ratio of 20.6%. The firm recently announced the acquisition of Vining Sparks, a provider of fixed income brokerage and investment services, further strengthening its position in the depository institution market. Despite market headwinds, Stifel's diversified business model and strategic investments position it well for continued growth in the future.
