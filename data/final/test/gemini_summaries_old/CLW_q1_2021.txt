In the first quarter of 2021, Clearwater Paper reported net sales of $426 million and adjusted EBITDA of $54 million. Notably, their paperboard business experienced strong demand, particularly in the folding carton segment, and the company has implemented price increases in response. However, the company's tissue business faced lower orders and shipments due to market trends, including consumer destocking and elevated inventory levels. To address this, the company is taking downtime on its assets to reduce inventory. Despite significant cost inflation, the company remains focused on implementing price increases and cost-saving measures. They are also exploring opportunities to reduce variable costs and improve their core operations through a recently launched transformation effort. The company's balance sheet remains strong with ample liquidity and no significant financial maintenance covenants. Additionally, they have revised their annual guidance to reflect continued price increases in the paperboard business, an expected impact from a major maintenance outage, and higher input costs in the tissue segment, including pulp, packaging, energy, and freight.
