Despite concerns that the Delta surge would negatively impact the economy, the CEO reports that it had minimal impact. The economy seems resilient, highlighting the adaptability of businesses to these disruptions. While labor shortages and supply chain disruptions remain challenges, the bank views these as manageable issues. The bank reported a net income of $87 million for the quarter, with net interest income slightly declining. The focus has shifted toward loan growth and improving deposits, with a plan to launch in new markets in the near future. Despite slower commercial loan growth due to payoffs and low line utilization, residential loans continued to perform strongly. Credit quality has improved, with classified assets and loans under deferral declining. The bank also reported a recovery of $11.8 million in the provision for credit losses and a stable NIM. Successful cost management resulted in a mid-single-digit increase in non-interest expenses.
