In the second quarter of 2021, Simpson Strong-Tie reported strong financial results with net sales of $410.3 million, marking a 25.8% increase year-over-year, primarily driven by product price increases and modest volume growth. These price increases, implemented in response to rising material costs, resulted in a higher gross margin of 47.9%, contributing to a 40.9% increase in income from operations to $101.7 million. Diluted earnings per share reached $1.66, a 36.1% increase.

Despite the impact of increasing raw material costs on margins, Simpson remains confident in its long-term growth initiatives. The company continues to invest in product innovation, technology advancements, and market expansion. Key initiatives include becoming a leader in engineered low-graded construction fastening solutions, strengthening building technology capabilities, and leveraging venture capital expertise to identify strategic acquisitions or investments.

To support these initiatives and return value to shareholders, the company has increased its dividend and remains active in share repurchases. While near-term margin compression is anticipated due to rising costs, Simpson aims to maintain an industry-leading operating margin in the high teens range over the long term. The company's commitment to safety, innovation, and growth positions it well to capitalize on future opportunities and achieve its five-year company ambitions.
