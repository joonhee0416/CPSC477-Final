Textron reported $3.3 billion in revenues for Q4 2021, primarily driven by improved aircraft utilization, low preowned inventory levels, and strong customer demand. Aviation had a solid quarter, achieving a segment margin of 10.1% and delivering 167 jets and 125 commercial turboprops. Defense divisions faced some challenges due to the wind down of the H-1 production program but saw increased commercial revenue at Bell and strong performance at Textron Systems. Textron's total revenues for the full year 2021 were $12.4 billion, representing an increase of $731 million compared to the previous year. For 2022, Textron projects revenue growth and expects earnings per share in the range of $3.80 to $4.00, with increased deliveries and higher aftermarket volume in aviation and improving supply chain conditions in specialized vehicles. The company also plans to expand its eAviation initiative, investing in developing technologies for sustainable flight.
