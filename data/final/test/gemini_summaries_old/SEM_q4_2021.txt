Select Medical reported impressive revenue growth in all segments for the year, with total revenue reaching $6.2 billion, a 12.2% increase from the previous year. However, substantial wage pressure, especially in agency and nursing rates, led to a decline in adjusted EBITDA margin to 8.9% in Q4 compared to 15.2% in the same quarter last year.

Critical Illness Recovery Hospitals saw revenue increase by 8.1% for the year, driven by a higher case mix index and patient days. However, labor cost increases have impacted EBITDA, which decreased from $342.4 million in the prior year to $268 million for the full year. Rehabilitation Hospitals also faced nurse agency pressure in Q4, reducing EBITDA in that segment.

Outpatient Rehab and Concentra segments remained strong throughout the year. Outpatient Rehab revenue increased by 17.9% with a 21.1% increase in patient visits, while Concentra's revenue grew by 15.4% and patient visits by 13.4%. These segments contributed significantly to the overall revenue growth and stability in adjusted EBITDA.

Despite the labor-related challenges, the company's diluted earnings per share increased to $2.98 for the full year from $1.93 in the prior year. Select Medical expects revenue between $6.25 billion and $6.4 billion for 2022 but plans to readdress its business outlook once the labor climate stabilizes.
