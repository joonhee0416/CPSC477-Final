Dun & Bradstreet reported strong Q2 results, with revenue growing 24.4% to $521 million and EBITDA increasing 12.6%. Organic revenue growth accelerated to 2.8%, driven by double-digit growth in the international segment and low single-digit growth in North America. The sequential improvement was attributed to new client wins, increased cross-selling, strong retention, and easing of headwinds. The company also saw strong sales in its building pipeline for new solutions, as businesses seek to leverage more of Dun & Bradstreet's offerings to support their post-pandemic operating models.

Dun & Bradstreet expanded its product portfolio with the launch of D&B ESG Intelligence, which provides standardized ESG scores and analytics. The company also announced new strategic hires, including Ginny Valentine as Chief Product Officer and Mike Schiff as Chief Technology Officer. The company's acquisition of Bisnode is progressing as planned, with top-line performance in line and synergy realization exceeding expectations.

Importantly, Dun & Bradstreet emphasized its key growth priorities: increasing its share of wallet with strategic clients, expanding into the SMB space, launching new products domestically and localizing them globally, and integrating the Bisnode acquisition. The company highlighted successful deals with Ceridian, Vintro, Barclays, Bayer, and Deutsche Bank, demonstrating its continued strengthening of relationships with Global 500 companies.

Dun & Bradstreet continues to see positive trends in the SMB market, with the launch of its D&B product and data marketplaces. E-commerce sales grew 73% year-over-year and are expected to double again by the end of Q3. The company's focus on new product development is evident, with 6% of revenue coming from new products in the quarter, up from 0.2% in Q2 2019.
