In the second quarter, Genie Energy achieved its highest-ever adjusted EBITDA and significantly improved financial performance compared to the prior year. Despite COVID-19 challenges, its retail energy businesses generated strong growth, driven by a 26% increase in electric consumption per meter and a decrease in customer acquisition expense. The company added 64,000 residential customer equivalents (RCEs) year-over-year, reaching a total of 421,000. In the international market, GRE International grew its RCEs by 40,000 and saw solid growth in its UK, Scandinavian, and Japanese operations. Genie Energy Services' Genie Solar generated positive adjusted EBITDA for the first time, and Diversegy approached breakeven. The company resumed share repurchases while continuing to pay an increased dividend. Overall, Genie Energy is well-positioned, with a solid balance sheet and a focus on returning value to shareholders. The company expects to see a modest rebound in meter acquisition in the third quarter, with the easing of COVID-19 restrictions.
