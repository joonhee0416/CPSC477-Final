John Deere reported a strong finish in fiscal year 2021 and provided an optimistic outlook for 2022. Net income for the year reached $5.96 billion. The company experienced robust demand across its divisions, with Construction & Forestry benefiting from strong housing and energy markets, Ag equipment continuing to benefit from strong commodity prices, and Small Ag & Turf remaining stable. For 2022, the company anticipates significant growth in all its segments, forecasting 10-15% net sales growth in Construction & Forestry, 15-20% in Small Ag & Turf, and 20-25% in Production & Precision Ag.
