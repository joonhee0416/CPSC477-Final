WESCO's Q2 results exceeded expectations, with strong sales and margin performance. Backlog reached a record high, driven by utility, commercial, and government sales growth. The company's merger with Anixter is progressing well, with over 50% of year one cost synergy targets already achieved. Anixter's legacy business contributed over $200 million in organic sales and 8.3% operating margin. WESCO plans to deploy Anixter's gross margin improvement programs across the legacy business. The combined company expects to capture over $200 million in synergies and generate over $600 million in free cash flow by year three. WESCO's focus is on integration, sales growth, and leveraging its resilient business model to navigate the challenging economic environment. Despite near-term challenges, the merger remains compelling, doubling WESCO's size and creating a transformed, industry-leading company.
