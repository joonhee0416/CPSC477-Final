Boyd Gaming has achieved exceptional financial results for the fifth consecutive quarter since reopening its properties last year, driven by a transformative shift in its operating model. The company's focus on loyalty and serving its core customers has resulted in a streamlined cost structure and enhanced efficiency. This strategy has led to record revenues and EBITDAR, with companywide margins surpassing 40% for the second straight quarter.

Every segment of the business contributed to the outstanding performance, with the Las Vegas Locals segment generating a 35% increase in revenue and nearly a 60% jump in EBITDAR. Downtown Las Vegas reported record third-quarter EBITDAR, and the Midwest and South segment set new records for both revenue and EBITDAR.

Boyd Gaming is also leveraging technology to enhance customer experiences and create growth opportunities. The BoydPay cashless technology is expanding to additional properties and will soon be available at table games in Nevada and Pennsylvania. The company is also expanding its iGaming operations, which are expected to generate over $20 million in EBITDAR this year.

Additionally, Boyd Gaming has strategic growth opportunities in the digital space and plans to further build its online casino capabilities. The company also continues to benefit from its 5% equity stake in FanDuel, which is a leader in the expansion of digital gaming.

Furthermore, Boyd Gaming remains committed to its ESG initiatives and is making progress in reducing its environmental footprint and enhancing the diversity of its workforce. The company has also extended full pay and benefits to team members affected by Hurricane Ida and has made significant contributions to support recovery efforts.

Overall, Boyd Gaming is well-positioned for continued growth and success. The company's Board of Directors has authorized a $300 million share repurchase program, reflecting its confidence in the future.
