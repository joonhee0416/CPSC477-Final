WestRock Corporation reported a solid first quarter for fiscal year 2022, exceeding expectations and aligning with guidance. Sales grew 13% year-over-year to $5 billion, driven by a combination of price and mix improvements offset by higher costs. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA increased 2% to $680 million, while adjusted earnings per share rose 6.6% to $0.65 per share.

To improve performance, WestRock has implemented a three-pronged strategic plan that includes driving growth, improving margins, and generating consistent ROIC. The company aims to capitalize on its unique portfolio, which combines consumer and corrugated packaging, paper, machinery, and distribution, to provide integrated solutions to customers.

Through pricing excellence, productivity enhancements, and cost control measures, WestRock plans to improve its margins. It will also invest in capacity expansion, optimize warehousing and logistics, and introduce automation and digital capabilities into its operations. Additionally, the company is evaluating non-core assets and implementing a disciplined capital deployment strategy.

WestRock's financial guidance for the second quarter of 2022 includes forecasted consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $780 million to $830 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.94 to $1.08 per share. Despite ongoing challenges with supply chain disruptions, COVID-19, and inflation, WestRock remains committed to its transformation plan and anticipates generating strong cash flows throughout the year.
