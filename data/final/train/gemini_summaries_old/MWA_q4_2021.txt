The company experienced a challenging fourth quarter, leading to a disappointing conversion margin but strong top-line growth. Consolidated net sales increased by 11.4%, driven by strong demand and higher pricing. However, an 8.1% decline in gross profit and increased operating expenses impacted adjusted EBITDA, which decreased by 20.8%. The unfavorable operating environment, including supply chain disruptions, labor challenges, and inflation, contributed to these challenges. Despite these obstacles, the company remains optimistic about its future. Record backlogs, higher pricing, and anticipated benefits from ongoing capital projects are expected to drive net sales and adjusted EBITDA growth in 2022. Additionally, the company's new management structure, focused on increasing revenue growth and operational excellence, aims to improve long-term profitability. The company is also investing in new product development and technology-enabled solutions, such as smart hydrants and software platforms. With a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity, the company is well-positioned to accelerate growth through capital investments and acquisitions while maintaining a balanced approach to capital allocation, including dividend increases and share repurchases.
