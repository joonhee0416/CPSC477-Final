Despite the impact of the pandemic, Teradata ended 2020 strongly with solid quarterly results, exceeding earnings per share and free cash flow expectations. The company's successful transition to a subscription model generated $1.587 billion in ARR, an 11% annual increase. Notably, public cloud ARR reached $106 million, surging by 165% year-over-year.

Teradata's cloud-first strategy is driving its growth, as evidenced by several significant customer wins in the public cloud space. The company's success is attributed to the increasing recognition of the value and cost-effectiveness of public cloud analytics.

To support its cloud initiatives, Teradata will invest 75% of its R&D budget in 2021, totaling over $200 million. The company anticipates significant year-over-year growth in public cloud ARR, total revenue, profitability, and free cash flow. The majority of its revenue will be recurring, leading to expected total revenue growth for the first time since 2018.

Teradata remains focused on driving cloud awareness and demand, refining its sales compensation structure, and aligning its marketing message to emphasize its cloud capabilities. Additionally, the company has received industry recognition as a leader in Gartner's Cloud Database Management Magic Quadrant.

Teradata's cloud strategy is complemented by its strategic divestment of consulting services and third-party software sales. By focusing on high-quality recurring product revenue, the company believes it can better showcase its growth.
