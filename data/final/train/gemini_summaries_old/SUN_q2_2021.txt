Sunoco's second quarter earnings showcase strong financial performance amidst rising commodity prices. Net income reached $166 million, while adjusted EBITDA rose to $201 million, driven by a 28% year-over-year increase in fuel volumes to 1.93 billion gallons. Despite margin challenges, Sunoco's fuel margin of $0.113 per gallon remains within its guidance range. Total operating expenses remained stable, contributing to a second-quarter distributable cash flow of $145 million. Sunoco's robust performance is also reflected in its strategic expansion of its midstream business. The acquisition of eight refined product terminals and one gasoline and distillate terminal is expected to enhance its core fuel distribution operations and provide a platform for future growth. Despite volume growth moderation in the third quarter, Sunoco remains optimistic about its volume trajectory and is on track to meet its full-year 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance of $725 million to $765 million. Additionally, Sunoco continues to pursue organic and acquisition-based growth in fuel distribution while maintaining financial discipline and focusing on the security of its distributions and balance sheet stability.
