Despite the challenges presented by the pandemic, Oshkosh Corporation's Q3 2020 results demonstrated resilience with consolidated sales of nearly $1.6 billion, adjusted earnings per share of $1.29, and a 6% year-over-year increase in backlog. The Access Equipment segment experienced a significant revenue decline, leading to temporary manufacturing closures and permanent cost reductions, including the closure of a facility in Romania. However, the Defense segment performed well, supported by JLTV production ramp-up and international opportunities, and also announced a joint venture in Saudi Arabia for tactical vehicle manufacturing. Fire & Emergency delivered solid results, recovering from supply chain issues, while the Commercial segment was impacted by lower demand for concrete mixers and refuse collection vehicles but implemented cost-saving measures and focused on product innovation with the new S Series 2.0 concrete mixer. To address the uncertainties of the pandemic, Oshkosh implemented temporary cost reductions exceeding $100 million and announced permanent restructuring actions in Access Equipment and Commercial segments, expected to yield $30-$35 million in annualized cost savings. The company maintains a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity and suspended share repurchases. Despite ongoing uncertainties, Oshkosh remains committed to delivering mid-20% adjusted decremental margins for the fourth quarter and full year on a consolidated basis.
