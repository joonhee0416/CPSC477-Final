Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) reported strong Q1 financial results, exceeding analyst expectations. Revenue reached $6.8 billion, driven by growth in the Intelligent Edge business and strong order intake. Gross margin expanded by 30 basis points year-over-year, reaching 33.7%, while operating margin increased by 130 basis points to 11.3%.
