Genesco's second-quarter performance significantly exceeded expectations, with revenue and earnings per share outperforming pre-pandemic levels. Driving this success was strong revenue, robust full-price selling, and effective expense management.

The company's footwear businesses set a new Q2 profit record, driven by elevated digital sales, which reached 19% of the total. Journeys' impressive performance was fueled by its competitive position in teen fashion footwear, with strong results in both stores and e-com.

Revenue for Schuh in the UK increased compared to pre-pandemic levels as government lockdowns lifted and consumers returned to physical stores. Despite higher online shopping, Schuh retained a substantial portion of online gains, resulting in online sales contributing almost 45% of total sales.

Johnston and Murphy experienced a faster-than-expected recovery, boosted by improved demand and successful new product launches. The brand's athletically inspired casual assortment performed exceptionally well, attracting new customers and expanding the brand's consumer reach.

Licensed brands revenue more than doubled, reflecting the growing contribution from the Levi's footwear license acquired in 2020. However, freight costs temporarily pressured near-term margins.

In the current quarter, sales are tracking ahead of pre-pandemic levels, supported by a strong back-to-school season. Supply chain challenges and the Delta variant's impact on consumer behavior remain factors to monitor in the second half of the year.

Genesco's ongoing footwear focus strategy is delivering results, with a focus on digital and omnichannel investments, product innovation, and cost-saving initiatives. The company has made significant progress in reshaping its cost structure, identifying over $20 million in savings, primarily in rent and other areas related to the store channel.

As Genesco looks ahead, it aims to continue improving its operating margins and return on invested capital by driving further digital growth, optimizing its store portfolio, and reducing its capital intensity. The company believes it has the right team and strategy to continue creating shareholder value in the evolving footwear industry.
