Select Medical experienced strong top-line growth in all business segments during Q2 2021, surpassing pre-pandemic levels. The inpatient/outpatient businesses posted record-high adjusted EBITDA. Concentra also saw significant growth, as industries such as hospitality and healthcare reopened. The company continues to expand through joint ventures and acquisitions, with the pending acquisition of Acuity Healthcare and recent partnerships with Cedars-Sinai and Ascension Saint Thomas.

Despite these positive developments, critical illness recovery hospitals faced staffing challenges, reducing occupancy and EBITDA margin. The rehabilitation hospital and outpatient rehab segments, however, recorded double-digit revenue increases and improved margins. Concentra's performance was particularly strong, with a large CARES Act payment contributing to its high adjusted EBITDA margin.

Overall, Select Medical's adjusted EBITDA surged 91.3% year-over-year, driven by revenue growth and margin improvement in most segments. Earnings per share jumped 213%, partially due to the CARES Act income. The company's net leverage has declined, and it has ample liquidity of nearly $1.4 billion. For the full year, Select Medical projects revenue of $5.85 billion to $6.05 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $970 million to $1 billion, and earnings per share of $2.91 to $3.08.
