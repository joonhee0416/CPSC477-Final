Comstock Resources reports a strong fourth quarter, driven by operational efficiencies and longer lateral drilling. The company's average lateral length in the fourth quarter reached a record 11,443 feet, including four 15,000-foot laterals. This resulted in lower drilling and completion costs, leading to improved capital efficiency and margins. Comstock's production increased 12% to 1.348 billion cubic feet per day, while EBITDAX grew 41% to $297 million. The company generated $105 million of free cash flow and reduced its debt by $265 million, with plans to pay off additional debt and return capital to shareholders in the future. Comstock's drilling inventory is at its strongest level in years, with over 1,400 net locations, and the longer laterals are expected to have a lower decline rate. The company expects to generate 4-5% production growth and over $500 million in free cash flow in 2022, with a continued focus on reducing costs and optimizing its drilling operations.
