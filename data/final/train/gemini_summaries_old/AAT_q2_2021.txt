American Assets Trust (AAT) reported a quarterly dividend increase to $0.30 per share, supported by improved collection efforts and strong performance at the Embassy Suites Hotel in Waikiki. The company appointed Adam Wyll as President and COO, highlighting his significant leadership during the pandemic and beyond.

AAT's portfolio is recovering from COVID-19's impact, with total revenue rising 9.3% and operating income increasing 31% in Q2. Same-store cash NOI increased 23% year-over-year, driven by strong office and retail performance. The company acquired Eastgate Office Park in Bellevue, Washington, for $125 million, providing an unleveraged IRR of over 7% and FFO accretion of $0.05 in 2021 and $0.10 in 2022.

In the office sector, AAT's portfolio is 93% leased, with less than 1% expiring in 2021. The company preserved pre-COVID rental rates, with new and renewal leases showing over 9% and 15% increases, respectively. A push to return to the office is driving tenant activity and competition for quality space, particularly in San Diego and Bellevue.

Multifamily revenues are rebounding, with occupancy at Hassalo on Eighth in Portland improving to 95% and rents trending up. Embassy Suites Hotel in Waikiki is seeing strong demand, with occupancy reaching 83% in June and average daily rates increasing to $262. AAT anticipates continued recovery as international travel restrictions ease.

AAT has approximately $718 million in liquidity, with leverage at 6.0 times net debt-to-EBITDA. The company expects to provide formal guidance for 2022 on its Q3 earnings call.
