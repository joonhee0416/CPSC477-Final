Meritage Homes reported a strong fourth quarter of 2020 driven by rising demand for affordable homes. The company experienced a 52% increase in orders and a 28% growth in home closing revenue compared to the same quarter in the previous year. This was primarily attributed to a shift towards entry-level and first move-up homes, which accounted for 70% of total orders.

Meritage's fourth-quarter home closing gross margin improved by 420 basis points to 24%, reflecting higher selling prices and improved operational efficiency. The company's sales strategy, optimized through contactless selling and digital enhancements, contributed to its increased sales volume and faster absorption pace.

Despite facing supply chain challenges and rising lumber costs, Meritage maintains a strong balance sheet with $746 million in cash and net debt-to-cap ratio at a record low of 10.5%. The company has secured enough land to achieve its target of 300 communities by mid-2022, while focusing on developing and replenishing its land pipeline for future growth.

For 2021, Meritage projects home closings between 11,500 and 12,500 units, resulting in home closing revenue ranging from $4.2 billion to $4.6 billion. The company anticipates a diluted earnings per share range of $10.50 to $11.50.
