Oceaneering's 2021 results exceeded expectations with adjusted EBITDA surpassing the guidance range and reaching $211 million. All operating segments delivered positive adjusted operating income and EBITDA for each quarter. The company generated robust free cash flow of $175 million, which allowed for debt reduction and an increase in cash position.

For 2022, Oceaneering projects consolidated revenue to grow over 10%, with increased revenue in all segments. Segment-wise, Subsea Robotics anticipates improved results due to increased ROV days on hire, geographic mix shifts, and stable pricing. Manufactured products expect to see a significant revenue increase from higher order intake in 2021. OPG projects marginal revenue growth with improved pricing and vessel utilization offsetting lower riserless light well intervention activities. IMDS forecasts higher revenue and ongoing global opportunities. AdTech expects growth in government-focused businesses.

Despite a projected lower first quarter due to seasonal factors, government appropriations uncertainties, and preparation expenses for increased activity, Oceaneering anticipates a ramp-up in financial results from the second quarter onwards. The company targets EBITDA of $225 million to $275 million and positive free cash flow of $75 million to $125 million for the full year. These projections assume supportive commodity prices and no significant COVID-19 impacts.
