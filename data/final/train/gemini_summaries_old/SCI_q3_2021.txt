In Q3 2021, Service Corporation International (SCI) exceeded expectations with adjusted earnings per share of $1.16, a 47% increase year-over-year. The primary driver was strong funeral results due to increases in both volume and sales average, and the cemetery segment delivered solid revenue growth from both at-need and preneed sources. Adjusted operating income grew $74 million, contributing over 85% of the earnings per share increase. SCI anticipates a decline in funeral volumes and cemetery revenues in Q4 compared to the prior year, but expects higher average revenue per funeral case and preneed sales production growth.

Despite the negative pull-forward effect of COVID-19 on revenues and earnings in the near term, SCI remains optimistic about its long-term growth prospects. The company anticipates an impressive earnings per share compounded annual growth rate in the next two years and beyond. This is attributed to the utilization of technology enhancements, cost efficiencies, and improvements in capital structure through share buybacks and debt maturity management. Even with projected volume declines in 2022, SCI expects earnings per share to reflect a 14% compounded growth rate over three years, reaching $2.80. By 2023, the company targets earnings per share approaching $3.25, maintaining a 14% growth rate. SCI's strong balance sheet and liquidity provide flexibility for opportunistic capital deployment in the future.
