Air Lease Corporation (ALC) reported mixed results for the second quarter of 2021. Earnings per share fell to $0.75 due to $87 million in revenue impact from lease restructurings and cash basis accounting. However, the company recorded positive margins and returns on equity, which are expected to improve as customers transition off cash accounting. ALC's total revenues were $492 million, down 6% year-over-year. Despite delivery of $1 billion in new aircraft, contributions were minimal due to timing.

ALC is encouraged by the resurgence in air travel and remains optimistic about the industry's recovery. International travel recovery is lagging behind domestic demand, with vaccinations and travel restrictions playing a crucial role. As vaccination rates increase and travel barriers ease, ALC anticipates a further rebound in air travel.

The company reported a decline in net deferrals from $131 million to $115 million. Operating cash flow increased significantly due to improved collection rates and deferral repayments. ALC maintains a strong competitive advantage with a low cost of funds and ample liquidity.

ALC continues to invest in its fleet, with $27.1 billion in rental commitments on new and existing aircraft. The company is seeing increased interest in single-aisle aircraft and has reinstated previously canceled MAX aircraft orders. Lease rates for new single aisles are improving.

Despite pandemic-related challenges, ALC's airline customers are choosing to operate younger aircraft from its fleet. Airlines globally are prioritizing sustainability initiatives, leading to orders for fuel-efficient aircraft. ALC believes the industry will evolve to address environmental footprint and operating efficiency concerns.
