In 2020, Molson Coors successfully executed its revitalization plan, leading to strong growth in its core brands and expansion beyond beer. Despite significant challenges from government restrictions on the on-premise channel in Europe, which accounted for 92% of the company's fourth-quarter top-line decline, Molson Coors grew net sales revenue in the United States and achieved a record high percentage of above-premium brands in the US portfolio. The company's successful innovations, including Vizzy, Blue Moon LightSky, and Coors Seltzer, contributed to a 2.3% increase in net sales per hectoliter in the US.

With its financial flexibility improving, Molson Coors is targeting a mid-single-digit net sales revenue increase in 2021, enabled by increased marketing spend for its core brands and support for recent launches. The company anticipates underlying EBITDA to remain flat due to increased investments in Europe, higher inflation, and transportation costs. Molson Coors is committed to maintaining its investment-grade rating and aims to reduce its net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio to 3.25 times by the end of 2021 and below 3 times by the end of 2022. The board of directors anticipates reinstating a dividend in the second half of 2021.
