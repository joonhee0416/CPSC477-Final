Unifi's Q3 performance exceeded expectations with 10% sequential and 5% year-over-year revenue growth. All regions experienced solid growth, with Brazil and Asia having strong sales and gross profit performance. EBITDA also performed well in Q3. The company's balance sheet and financial performance provide opportunities for future growth. Q4 sales are anticipated to improve sequentially by 1% to 3%, while adjusted EBITDA is estimated to be between $12 million and $14 million, considering pandemic uncertainty and raw material cost increases. The management team is confident in the company's underlying business momentum and responsiveness to cost headwinds. REPREVE-branded fiber continues to gain momentum, comprising 33% of net sales in Q3. Unifi has surpassed 25 billion bottles recycled into REPREVE and celebrated its Champions of Sustainability Awards to recognize customer milestones. The company's strong financial position has supported two bolt-on acquisitions in fiscal 2021, with ongoing capex allocation for new eAFK Evo texturing technology.
