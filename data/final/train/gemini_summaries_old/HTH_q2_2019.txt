For Q2 2019, Hilltop reported a strong performance with net income of $57.8 million, a 77% increase compared to the previous year, resulting in earnings per share of $0.62. This growth was driven by significant increases in pre-tax income across the bank, mortgage, and broker-dealer businesses.

Hilltop's bank recorded a 41% increase in pre-tax income, primarily due to higher yields on increased loan balances and operational efficiency. Mortgage pre-tax income improved by 56%, driven by disciplined pricing and expense management amid a 4% decline in origination volume. The broker-dealer reported a very strong quarter, with a 35% increase in net revenues propelled by higher production levels and favorable market conditions in structured finance.

Credit quality remains a priority for Hilltop, and nonperforming assets have decreased compared to the prior year and second quarter of 2018. The bank maintains a strong capital position with a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 16.32% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 13%.

To address market pressures and enhance efficiency, Hilltop has implemented a Platform for Growth and Efficiency initiative. This has resulted in ongoing cost savings and the anticipation of further benefits in 2021.

Despite a decline in interest rates, Hilltop expects full-year average prepurchase accounting net interest margin to remain within its previously projected range of 3.25% plus or minus 3 basis points. Noninterest income is projected to be higher than the original outlook, while noninterest expenses are slightly adjusted higher due to variable compensation being correlated to fee revenue businesses. Hilltop has also lowered its provision outlook range based on solid credit quality and first-half performance.

Overall, Hilltop Holdings delivered a strong quarter and remains focused on maintaining solid credit quality, executing its growth initiatives, and delivering value to its stockholders.
