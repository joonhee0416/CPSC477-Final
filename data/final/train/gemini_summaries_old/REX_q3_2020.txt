REX American Resources Corporation reported a notable increase in sales by 43% due to enhanced production levels, resulting in a substantial gross profit for the ethanol segment. The company's crush spread significantly improved, reflecting lower corn pricing. Despite a gross loss in the refined coal segment, tax benefits offset these losses. Net income reached $8.8 million, with earnings per share of $1.44. The company has a strong cash position with over $202 million. However, the recent decline in crush margins due to higher corn prices and reduced ethanol demand is a concern. Nonetheless, REX American Resources is optimistic about the potential positive impact of the Biden administration's policies related to ethanol. The company is also exploring opportunities for carbon capture and repurchase of shares. Additionally, the corn crops in the company's draw area show promise, and the company continues to invest in improved production practices. Overall, despite the challenges faced by the industry, REX American Resources delivered a profitable quarter, highlighting the strength of its operations and the dedication of its employees.
