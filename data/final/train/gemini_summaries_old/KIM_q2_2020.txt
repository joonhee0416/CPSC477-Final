Kimco's Q2 earnings call highlighted the company's resilience amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the challenges, the company maintained a strong portfolio and liquidity position. Operating metrics remained positive, with 95.6% occupancy and new lease spreads of 12%. Tenant retention efforts have been successful, with 94% of tenants open and only 3% of ABR subject to closures.

To navigate the pandemic, Kimco focused on tenant relations, working with retailers to restructure leases and enhance redevelopment opportunities. This approach has strengthened relationships and bodes well for future growth.

The transaction market remains limited, but opportunities are emerging in categories such as essential retailers looking to raise cash and owners seeking capital for growth. Kimco sees potential in these areas and is exploring investment opportunities.

Financially, Kimco reported a Q2 NAREIT FFO of $103.5 million, impacted by an increase in credit loss reserves due to COVID-19. However, the company achieved incremental NOI from development projects and reduced financing costs. Its liquidity position remains strong, with over $200 million in cash and a $2 billion revolver. Kimco repaid $265 million of a term loan with proceeds from the partial sale of its Albertsons investment.

Despite the uncertainties surrounding the pandemic, Kimco intends to maintain a dividend level that covers taxable income. The company believes its strong team, portfolio, and balance sheet will enable it to weather the storm and succeed in the long term.
