Mettler-Toledo reported strong fourth-quarter and full-year 2019 results, driven by growth initiatives and productivity efforts. Total sales increased 3% in the quarter, with Laboratory and Industrial businesses performing well. The company managed to offset headwinds from currency and tariffs, resulting in a 14% growth in adjusted earnings per share. For the full year, local currency sales grew 5%, and the company achieved a 12% increase in adjusted earnings per share.

However, the company anticipates challenges in the near term due to the coronavirus outbreak in China, which is expected to significantly impact sales in the first quarter. Mettler-Toledo estimates that China sales will decline mid- to high single-digits in Q1, resulting in an adjustment of its sales guidance.

Despite the coronavirus impact, the company maintains its full-year guidance of 4% local currency sales growth, driven by share gains and ongoing productivity initiatives. However, it expects currency and tariffs to reduce earnings per share growth by 2% for the full year. In Q1, adjusted earnings per share are projected to grow 2% to 5%, excluding currency and tariffs.

Mettler-Toledo's strong product portfolio, including Laboratory solutions with the "power of the bench" concept and innovative Industrial offerings like InVision, remains a key differentiator. The company is confident in its ability to execute its growth strategy and deliver solid cash flow generation in 2020 amidst macroeconomic uncertainty.
