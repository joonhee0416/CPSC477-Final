Whitestone REIT performed relatively well in Q2 despite the challenges posed by the pandemic. Q2 revenue was $2.8 million, slightly down from the same period last year. Occupancy remained stable at 89.2%, with positive leasing spreads of 13.5% and 3.4%. Rent collection improved to 81% in Q2 and further to 86% for July. The company's strategy of investing in open-air shopping centers in favorable markets like Texas and Arizona, along with its strong culture and experienced management team, has contributed to its resilience. Whitestone's proactive approach, including digital signing and support for tenant businesses, is expected to generate additional revenue streams. The company's financial position remains solid, with $45 million in cash and ample borrowing capacity. Whitestone is well-positioned to capture pent-up demand and continue delivering value to shareholders through collaboration, innovation, and strategic decision-making.
