In Q3, Brandywine generated FFO of $0.35 per share, meeting consensus estimates. Rentable occupancy is expected to be within the stated range based on scheduled lease commencements in Q4. While the volume of executed leases was lower quarter-over-quarter, the overall pipeline has significantly increased by 330,000 square feet. The portfolio had positive absorption of 102,000 square feet, driven by various factors, including a full building delivery in Pennsylvania and backfilling of SHI space in Austin, Texas. Rent collection rates remain strong, with over 99% of Q3 billings collected. The company's capital costs were in line with expectations.

Brandywine has implemented risk mitigation plans during the pandemic, focusing on rent collection, rent deferrals, and strategic tenant outreach. Despite the headwinds, they remain focused on growth through early lease renewal programs and margin-improving rebidding programs. The leasing pipeline stands at 1.6 million square feet, with approximately 400,000 square feet in advanced stages of negotiations.

Brandywine's liquidity position remains strong, with a projected $530 million of its line of credit available by year-end. They have no further maturities until 2023. Development projects are progressing well, with 405 Colorado expected to be completed in Q2 2021 and 3000 Market fully leased to Spark Therapeutics. They are actively marketing production assets, with a pipeline of almost 200,000 square feet on 405 Colorado.

Brandywine is exploring equity financing options with various investors and private equity firms. They continue to evaluate asset-level joint ventures and sales to enhance returns, generate liquidity, and support the development pipeline. However, they will not provide 2021 guidance at this time due to the ongoing uncertainty of the pandemic's impact.
