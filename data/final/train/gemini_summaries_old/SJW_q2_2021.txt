In the midst of extreme weather conditions, SJW Group reported a 3.4% increase in second-quarter revenue, driven by rate increases, increased customer usage, and new customers. Diluted earnings per share remained steady at $0.69, supported by rate increases, a purchase price holdback, and higher usage. However, California's drought conditions impacted surface water production, resulting in increased production costs.

For the first six months of 2021, revenue rose by 2%, with net income increasing to $0.79 per diluted share. Rate increases and non-regulated income contributed to this growth, partially offset by decreased California surface water production and increased expenses.

Despite a lower-than-expected regulatory decision in Connecticut, SJW Group remains confident in meeting its revenue targets through the Water Revenue Adjustment Mechanism and future WICA filings. The company is also cautiously optimistic about its Texas operations, with an acquisition filing made to expand its presence in fast-growing counties.

In addition to its financial results, SJW Group emphasized its commitment to environmental stewardship, including efforts to protect water resources, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and implement conservation programs. The company also made progress on its advanced metering infrastructure deployment and water treatment project in Maine, while maintaining a strong growth trajectory for its Texas subsidiary.
