Advanced Drainage Systems (ADS) reported a record $706 million in sales for Q2, a 30% increase from the same period last year, driven by pricing increases and a slight increase in volume. Infiltrator sales grew 38% due to favorable pricing and increased demand in the Southeastern and Southern regions. International sales also rose by 29%, with double-digit growth in Canada and Mexico. Despite production constraints, the company maintains a strong backlog and has implemented price increases that will fully impact Q3. However, adjusted EBITDA decreased 5% due to labor shortages in manufacturing and transportation, negatively impacting profitability. ADS is implementing self-help programs to increase production capacity, including the installation of new equipment and expansions at existing facilities. Capital spending doubled in the first half of FY22, with investments focused on capacity expansion, automation, and productivity initiatives. ADS remains confident in its long-term growth prospects and continues to execute on its self-help programs to mitigate supply chain challenges and expand margins in the future.
