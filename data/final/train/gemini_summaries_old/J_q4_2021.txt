Jacobs Engineering reported impressive financial results, showcasing strong growth and profitability. The company's fourth-quarter net revenue increased 7% year-over-year, driven by strong performance from its People & Places Solutions (P&PS) and PA Consulting businesses. Adjusted EBITDA grew 12% during the quarter, demonstrating the company's ability to expand margins.

PA Consulting continued to exceed expectations, with a 41% revenue growth in Q4, contributing $273 million in revenue and $66 million in operating profit. The company's expertise in ESG and digital solutions is expected to drive continued growth in the coming years.

P&PS had a solid quarter, with continued wins in climate response, pandemic solutions, infrastructure modernization, and digitization. The company's focus on higher-value solutions has resulted in improved gross margins.

Jacobs is optimistic about fiscal 2022, expecting double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth. The passage of the U.S. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is anticipated to provide a significant boost to the company's growth in the second half of the year.

Looking ahead, Jacobs expects to deliver approximately $10 of adjusted earnings per share in fiscal year 2025, driven by organic growth opportunities in infrastructure, climate response, and digital transformation. The company's strategic investments in these areas, coupled with its strong balance sheet and commitment to shareholder value, position it for long-term success.
