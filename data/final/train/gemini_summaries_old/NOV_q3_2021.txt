NOV reported a decrease in third-quarter revenue compared to the previous quarter, primarily due to a decline in its Completion & Production Solutions segment and a lower-than-expected performance in its Rig Technologies segment. Despite this, excluding one-time credits from the prior quarter, revenues were essentially flat, and EBITDA improved on a sequential basis. NOV's Wellbore Technologies segment continued to perform strongly, driven by increased demand for drilling equipment and tools. The company expects sequential revenue growth in this segment for the fourth quarter. The Completion & Production Solutions segment is expected to benefit from improved backlogs and growing aftermarket activity, leading to potential revenue improvements in the mid-teens. Rig Technologies is also facing supply chain challenges but is optimistic about the future due to tailwinds such as increased maintenance spending and potential rig activation projects. Overall, NOV remains confident in its long-term outlook, citing strengthening commodity prices, oilfield activity, and continued investments in technologies and products related to the energy transition.
