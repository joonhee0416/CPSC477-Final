Quanta Services reported a record third-quarter revenue of $3.4 billion, driven by strong demand for its services, including emergency restoration revenue from Hurricane Ida. The company's electric power operations performed well, with record revenues and margins, supported by favorable demand for grid modernization, renewable energy interconnection, and electric vehicle infrastructure installation. Quanta's acquisition of Blattner, a leading renewable energy infrastructure solutions provider, further positions the company to capitalize on the energy transition and expand its offerings for North America's carbon-neutral energy infrastructure. The total backlog at the end of the quarter was a record $17 billion, with the addition of Blattner's backlog expected to increase it further. Quanta expects full-year revenue to be between $12.55 billion and $12.85 billion, including contributions from recently acquired companies. Adjusted EBITDA is projected between $1.21 billion and $1.26 billion, with diluted earnings per share between $3.20 and $3.40. Despite challenges in the Gulf Coast due to Hurricane Ida and the ongoing impact of COVID-19, Quanta anticipates its industrial services to strengthen in the coming year. The company also noted potential opportunities for its underground utility and infrastructure solutions segment as customers pursue carbon reduction initiatives and invest in hydrogen blending and renewable processing facilities.
