Genesco's Q4 performance exceeded expectations across the board, with a record digital revenue of $450 million. Journeys drove the growth, delivering record operating profit and store sales that outperformed expectations. Schuh also gained market share, despite store closures in the U.K. Johnston & Murphy, facing challenges due to the pandemic, is shifting its focus towards a more casual footwear offering.

Despite a 6% decline in total revenue, gross margins improved sequentially, driven by Journeys' strong performance. Expense containment measures, including rent abatements, resulted in a significant reduction in total expenses. This drove an increase in operating income year over year.

Looking ahead, Genesco anticipates an improvement in Q1 compared to the prior year, but lower than pre-pandemic levels of Q1 2020. This is primarily due to continued store closures in the U.K. and pressure on Johnston & Murphy. Gross margins are also expected to be lower in Q1. The company believes it will be difficult to turn a profit in Q1 due to the seasonality of the business.

However, Genesco is optimistic about a stronger recovery in the back half of the year. The company is investing in digital and omnichannel initiatives to accelerate its growth. It is also planning to increase inventory levels and open new stores, mainly at Journeys.

To adapt to the changing business landscape, Genesco is reshaping its cost structure with the goal of reducing operating expenses by $25-30 million annually. This will support investments in growth and improve operating margins.

Genesco remains focused on its six strategic growth pillars, including enhancing customer relationships, product innovation, digital acceleration, cost optimization, and potential acquisitions. Despite the challenges of the pandemic, the company believes it has emerged with a stronger foundation and is well-positioned for future success.
