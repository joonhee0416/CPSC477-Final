Marsh McLennan's second quarter performance was exceptional, highlighted by record revenue and earnings, the best underlying growth in two decades, and a 33% surge in adjusted earnings per share. The company benefited from strong economic conditions, increased demand for its services amid uncertainty, and a "flight to quality" trend. All businesses and major geographies experienced accelerated growth, with particularly strong underlying revenue growth in RIS (13%) and Consulting (12%). Marsh reported its highest quarterly underlying growth in nearly two decades (14%), fueled by strong business and renewal growth. Guy Carpenter maintained its impressive results with 12% underlying growth, while Mercer rebounded with 6% growth, its highest in almost a decade. Oliver Wyman posted a record 28% reported underlying revenue growth. Despite challenging expense comparisons, the company achieved margin expansion of 90 basis points. Marsh McLennan's strong momentum and favorable market dynamics are expected to continue for the remainder of the year, leading to solid growth and margin expansion. The company remains focused on capitalizing on opportunities in areas such as cyber security, climate change, and the acquisition of small commercial business.
