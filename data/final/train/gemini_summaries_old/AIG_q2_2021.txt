AIG reported strong financial results for the second quarter, driven by exceptional performance in General Insurance. Net premiums written in General Insurance increased 24% year-over-year, reflecting growth in both Global Commercial and Personal lines. The accident year combined ratio ex CAT improved to 91.1%, down from 94.9% in the prior-year quarter. This improvement was driven by strong underwriting discipline, portfolio optimization, and the execution of AIG 200.

Life and Retirement also posted solid results, primarily driven by improved investment performance. Adjusted pre-tax income increased 26% year-over-year, and the business delivered a return on adjusted segment common equity of 16.4%.

AIG made significant progress on its AIG 200 transformation program, which remains on track to deliver $1 billion in run rate savings by the end of 2022. The company also announced a strategic partnership with Blackstone, which represents a major step forward in the planned IPO of Life and Retirement. The transaction will provide AIG with $2.2 billion in cash and accelerate the separation process.

AIG remains focused on capital management, with near-term priorities being debt reduction, return of capital to shareholders through share repurchases, and investment in organic growth. In the second half of 2021, the company plans to repurchase at least $2 billion in common stock and reduce debt outstanding by $2.5 billion.

Overall, AIG's strong performance in the second quarter demonstrates the company's commitment to underwriting discipline, portfolio optimization, and operational excellence. The AIG 200 transformation program is progressing well, and the strategic partnership with Blackstone positions Life and Retirement for future growth and value creation.
