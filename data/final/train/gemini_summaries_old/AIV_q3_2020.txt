In a challenging third quarter amidst the pandemic, Aimco faced operational setbacks but demonstrated resilience. Despite government regulations and economic distress, the company saw a resurgence in leasing space and reduced vacancies. Aimco's customer-centric approach and stringent resident selection standards contributed to high collection rates. However, local ordinances allowing rent-free living resulted in significant bad debt, primarily from residents evading rent payments since April. Despite these challenges, the company expects bad debt to improve once emergency ordinances expire. Aimco reduced its leverage by $1 billion and announced plans to separate into two entities: AIR, focused on stabilized apartments, and New Aimco, handling development and redevelopment. This separation aims to enhance financial risk management, increase FFO and dividends, and reduce costs. Encouraging signs indicate a recovery in the apartment market, with leasing pace and occupancy rates improving. Aimco's strong balance sheet, disciplined operations, and proactive investment strategy position the company for long-term growth and return to shareholders.
