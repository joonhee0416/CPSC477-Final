Aflac's third quarter performance saw a 10.1% increase in adjusted earnings per diluted share, driven by lower benefit ratios and higher net investment income in Japan. Aflac Japan's profit margin was strong at 26.3%, with a premium persistency of 94.5%. Sales were flat for the quarter and remain below 2019 levels due to pandemic-related challenges in face-to-face interactions. Despite these obstacles, Aflac Japan launched a new nursing care insurance product and resumed proactive sales of cancer insurance. Aflac U.S. also had a strong quarter, with a profit margin of 22.2% fueled by lower incurred benefits and higher adjusted net investment income. Sales increased 35% as pandemic conditions improved, allowing for more face-to-face meetings and enrollments. Aflac U.S. is investing in new products such as Dental and Vision premier life and disability, which are expected to contribute to future growth. Pandemic conditions remain uncertain, but Aflac is focused on maintaining strong capital ratios, continuing its dividend increases, and investing in growth initiatives to ensure long-term success.
