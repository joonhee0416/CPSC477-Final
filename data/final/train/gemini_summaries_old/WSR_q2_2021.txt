Whitestone REIT experienced robust performance in Q2 2021, driven by increased demand and strong leasing activity. Total occupancy rose to 89.9%, with new leases contributing 75,000 square feet of occupied space. Positive leasing spreads of 6.8% were achieved on new and renewal leases, alongside annual rent increases of 2%-3%. The company's diversified tenant base, which includes essential service providers and small businesses, played a key role in capturing sales revenue and driving foot traffic. This resulted in a 18% increase in foot traffic at its centers in the first half of the year.

Despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, Whitestone maintained high collection levels, reflecting the resilience of its tenant base. The company's strategic focus on Sunbelt markets, where population migration and economic recovery are evident, contributed to its success. Whitestone's balance sheet strengthened with a decrease in debt, and an improvement in debt-to-EBITDA ratio from 9.4 to 8.2 times.

The company's 59 properties, totaling approximately 5 million square feet, generated revenue of $30.6 million in Q2. Whitestone's commitment to adding leasable square footage through development and redevelopment opportunities is expected to enhance its asset value. The company's dividend remains well-funded, with a payout ratio of 41% of FFO Core, and a 2.4% increase in March 2021. Whitestone believes that the intrinsic value of its assets is not yet fully reflected in its market valuation and expects this to improve as it continues to grow occupancy, revenue, and cash flow.
