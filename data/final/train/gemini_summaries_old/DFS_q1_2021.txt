Discover Financial Services reported impressive first-quarter results, with earnings of $5.04 per share. Despite the ongoing pandemic, the company's credit performance remained strong, enabling it to release $879 million in reserves. Loan growth was modest due to elevated payment rates, but Discover anticipates acceleration later in the year. Despite the payment rate pressure, the company intends to increase marketing spending to drive account acquisition and expand credit standards in line with pre-pandemic levels. Operating expenses remained relatively flat, with marketing spend down significantly from the prior year but expected to rise through the rest of 2021. Non-interest income grew 2% year-over-year, excluding a one-time gain. Discover's net interest margin improved due to lower deposit pricing and a favorable shift in funding mix. The company anticipates credit losses to be flat to down this year, with the possibility of some increase in 2022. Discover also announced the restart of its share repurchase program and expects to increase capital returns to shareholders in the second half of the year. Overall, Discover's financial performance reflects its robust business model, strong execution, and the ongoing economic recovery.
