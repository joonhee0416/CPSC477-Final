Pentair reported solid first-quarter performance with adjusted earnings per share exceeding the high end of previous guidance, despite COVID-19's initial impact in China and later globally. To mitigate revenue declines, the company is actively reducing costs, including manufacturing labor reductions and deferred nonlabor outside spending. Pentair's liquidity position remains strong, with no meaningful debt maturities for the next few years and cash on hand of $169 million. The company expects a recessionary environment in 2020 and is planning for significant demand reductions. Key hires for both CFO and segment structure have been announced, including Mario D'Ovidio for the Consumer Solutions segment and Jerome Pedretti for the Industrial & Flow Technologies segment. Pentair remains focused on protecting its employees, customers, and businesses while optimizing free cash flow and liquidity. Despite near-term challenges, the company is confident in its long-term goals and strategies, and is well-positioned with its portfolio, installed base, and limited industrial manufacturing exposure to recover when markets improve.
