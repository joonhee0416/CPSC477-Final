Simpson Manufacturing reported strong first-quarter earnings, with sales increasing 22.6% to $347.6 million primarily due to increased sales in the home center distribution channel and strong trends in U.S. housing starts. Gross margin expanded to 46.7% from 45.7% in the prior year quarter, driven by lower labor and production costs. The company has implemented two price increases to offset rising material costs, which are expected to support gross profit margins through the year. Simpson outlined its growth initiatives focused on expanding into new markets in wood and concrete products, becoming a leader in engineered load-rated construction fastener solutions, and investing in customer-facing technology. The company's ambitious goals include strengthening its values-based culture, becoming the partner of choice, leading in product innovation, continuing above-market growth relative to U.S. housing starts, and expanding its return on invested capital. Despite macroeconomic turbulence, Simpson expects the second quarter to show strong momentum due to increased housing starts. The company will prioritize investing in growth initiatives and M&A to expand its product line and market share.
