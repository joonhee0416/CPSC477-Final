Across its brands, Coach delivered exceptional results with a 27% increase in revenue, fueled by high AUR growth and strong customer engagement.

For fiscal year 2022, Tapestry projects revenue of approximately $6.6 billion, representing a mid-teens increase, and operating income growth at the high end of its previous expectations. The company expects modest operating margin expansion, despite some gross margin pressure due to increased freight investments.

This move reflects the company's confidence in its brands' growth trajectory and its commitment to value creation for shareholders.
