In Q2 2021, American Equity Life reported $1.2 billion in annuity sales, a decrease from Q1's record $2.4 billion. However, FIA sales surged 33% sequentially to $887 million, marking the third consecutive quarter of increased FIA market share. American Equity Life's FIA sales grew 36% to $703 million, driven by the revamped AssetShield series. Eagle Life's FIA sales also increased significantly, reflecting the success of its new income product and higher employee salesforce. Additionally, the company introduced EstateShield, a new income offering in the non-guaranteed space, which received strong support from distribution partners. Despite the strong performance in FIA sales, overall results were impacted by the transitionary effects of excess cash in the portfolio and elevated operating expenses. The company emphasized its commitment to deploying excess cash and investing in privately sourced assets, with a target of 5% annual growth in the portfolio. In terms of financial results, non-GAAP operating income per share was $0.98, down slightly from the previous year. The investment portfolio performed well, with the net unrealized gain position improving by $1.2 billion. The company continues to update its corporate governance practices, including target director size and retirement age. Overall, American Equity Life remains focused on transitioning to its AEL 2.0 strategy, which involves introducing new products, revitalizing go-to-market strategies, and investing in infrastructure upgrades.
