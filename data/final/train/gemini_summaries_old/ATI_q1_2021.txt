ATI reported a loss per share of $0.06 in Q1, outperforming initial guidance due to favorable metal prices and higher-than-expected earnings from their Precision Rolled Specialty Strip business in China. The company experienced a 16% year-over-year decrease in sales, driven by lower demand for standard stainless sheet products in their Specialty Rolled Products business unit. However, demand for jet engine forgings and specialty materials improved, particularly in the commercial aerospace market, reflecting increasing narrowbody production rates. The company noted that its cost reduction efforts have positioned them to benefit from the upcoming global economic recovery, especially in aerospace. Despite facing a strike by USW-represented employees in the Specialty Rolled Products business, ATI remains committed to its transformation plan to improve profitability and competitiveness in this segment. The company has strong liquidity and a solid cash flow outlook, supported by improving market conditions and its cost optimization initiatives. ATI expects sequential revenue and earnings growth in Q2, primarily driven by increasing demand in commercial aerospace, energy, and defense. However, the ongoing strike remains a source of uncertainty, and the company cannot provide earnings guidance for the quarter. Despite this, ATI remains confident in achieving its full-year 2021 free cash flow guidance range of $20 million to $60 million.
