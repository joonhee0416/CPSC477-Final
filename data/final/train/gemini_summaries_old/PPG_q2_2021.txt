PPG reported robust Q2 results with record net sales of $4.4 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.94. Despite strong sales, the company faced disruptions from supply and component issues, which led to an estimated $200 million impact, higher than the initial forecast. Raw material inflation was also a significant factor, with mid- to high-teen percentage increases year-over-year. These challenges, primarily in the automotive sector, resulted in lower-than-expected adjusted earnings. However, the company remains confident in recovering deferred sales in later quarters and is offsetting inflation with price increases. PPG completed three acquisitions in Q2 and expects those to contribute $500 million in incremental sales in Q3. The company has secured further price increases in response to ongoing raw material cost pressures and expects to offset inflation by Q4. PPG projects low single-digit sales growth in Q3 and full-year adjusted earnings of $7.40 to $7.60, representing a 13% increase over 2019. The Board also approved a 10% dividend increase, marking 50 consecutive years of annual dividend growth.
