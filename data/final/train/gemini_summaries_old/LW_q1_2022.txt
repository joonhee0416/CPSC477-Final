Lamb Weston's earnings call outlined strong demand recovery in the first quarter, with sales growth driven by volume and price mix. However, higher manufacturing and distribution costs, including double-digit inflation for edible oils and transportation, overshadowed sales growth, resulting in lower earnings. Despite these challenges, the company is optimistic about the recovery in French fry demand, especially in the U.S., and believes it provides a solid foundation for future growth.

Aggressive pricing actions are underway to mitigate rising input costs, and the company expects to realize some benefits in the second quarter and more fully in the third quarter. However, due to the severity of the potato crop impact and continued supply chain disruptions, including labor shortages and transportation challenges, gross margins are expected to remain below pre-pandemic levels throughout fiscal 2022.

Lamb Weston is implementing various cost-saving measures, including optimizing its product portfolio, implementing productivity programs, and managing labor availability. Additionally, it is increasing freight rates charged to customers and adjusting them more frequently to better reflect market rates.

Despite the earnings pressures, the company is maintaining its sales growth target above its long-term range for fiscal 2022. However, it predicts that earnings will remain under pressure for the remainder of the year. The company expects to provide a more detailed assessment of the crop impact on earnings when it releases its second quarter results in January.
