Yum! Brands reported strong third-quarter results, driven by record-breaking unit development and sustained digital sales. Despite COVID-related challenges, the company opened 760 net new units globally, with KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell contributing to the growth. System sales grew 8%, with same-store sales up 5%. Strong sales were seen in the U.S., U.K., and Canada, along with recovery in Europe. Digital sales reached over $5 billion, accounting for nearly 40% of sales. Yum! acquired Dragontail Systems to enhance delivery capabilities and improve restaurant operations. KFC saw 6% same-store sales growth, driven by international growth and continued success of the chicken sandwich in the U.S. Pizza Hut's same-store sales increased 4%, with significant growth in off-premise channels. Taco Bell posted 5% same-store sales growth and expanded into new category entry points like breakfast and fried chicken. Habit Burger Grill delivered 11% same-store sales growth, highlighting the brand's strength. The company's unmatched operating capability and Bold Restaurant Development growth drivers contributed to the strong results. Core operating profit grew 3%, driven by strategic technology investments, including Dragontail Systems, and the expansion of Taco Bell's All Access technology. Yum! remains focused on its "Recipe for Good" agenda, addressing climate action, sustainable packaging, and inequality issues. Despite labor and cost inflation pressures, the company believes its scale and franchisee strength will help navigate these challenges. The company maintains a solid balance sheet, invests in the business, pays dividends, and repurchases shares.
