Unum Group's Q1 2021 results reflected a solid start to the year, with adjusted operating income of $1.04 per diluted common share, excluding certain items. The core business performed well, with premium growth driven by strong persistency and the rebound in sales. The company anticipates a strong recovery in earnings in the second half of the year due to improving economic conditions, including the decline in COVID-related mortality and infection rates.

Despite the ongoing challenges from the pandemic, Unum's core businesses, including disability, group life, and employee benefits, showed resilience. The company highlighted positive trends in most product lines, with favorable benefits experience in disability, voluntary benefits, and long-term care. However, COVID-19 continued to impact life insurance operations, leading to higher claims and premium declines in some areas.

Unum's investment portfolio also showed improvement, with the alternative asset portfolio fully recovering from earlier markdowns. The company is pleased with the quality of its portfolio and has seen limited credit concerns and an improved outlook for upgrades.

Regarding capital, Unum's position remains strong, with ample cash reserves and a favorable risk-based capital ratio. The company is evaluating options to deploy capital in ways that maximize shareholder value, including investments in growth, dividends, and share repurchases.

Overall, Unum is optimistic about its ability to return to pre-pandemic profitability and margins in the coming quarters. The company believes that its strong financial position and strategic focus position it well for the future.
