In the fourth quarter, American States Water Company reported a strong 20% increase in earnings per share to $0.54, driven by contributions from all three operating segments. The annual dividend was also increased by nearly 10%, marking the 66th consecutive year of annual dividend increases. The water segment benefited from higher water gross margin due to new water rates authorized by the CPUC, while the electric segment saw an increase in earnings due to rate increases and lower operating and interest expenses. The contracted services segment also reported growth in earnings due to increased construction activity and lower operating expenses. Despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, the company maintained essential services and invested $123.4 million in company-funded infrastructure at its regulated utilities. In 2021, the company expects to invest between $120 million to $135 million in capital projects. The company also remains committed to its dividend growth policy, targeting a compound annual growth rate in the dividend of more than 7% over the long term.
