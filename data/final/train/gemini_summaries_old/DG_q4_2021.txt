Dollar General reported a 2.8% increase in net sales to $8.7 billion in Q4 of 2021, despite challenges such as inflation, supply chain pressure, and COVID-19 cases. However, comparable sales declined 1.4% compared to the prior year. The decline was primarily attributed to lower customer traffic, partially offset by growth in average basket size to $16 and approximately six items. Despite the challenges, Dollar General remains confident in its price position and the importance of $1 price point products to their customers, with approximately 20% of their assortment falling into this category.

For the full year, net sales increased 1.4% to $34.2 billion, with a 13.5% increase on a two-year stack basis. Same-store sales decreased 2.8% but increased 13.5% over the last two years. Over 2,900 real estate projects were completed during the year, including the opening of their 18,000th store and 50 stand-alone pOpshelf locations. The company remains focused on growth opportunities and strategic initiatives, such as expanding the pOpshelf concept and investing in their health and international initiatives.

Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased 131 basis points in Q4 due to factors including LIFO, higher transportation and distribution costs, and a greater proportion of sales coming from their consumables category. SG&A expenses decreased 16 basis points, driven by lower COVID-19 costs. Operating profit decreased 8.7% to $797 million, with a 116 basis point decrease as a percentage of sales. Earnings per share decreased 1.9% to $2.57.

The company's financial position remains strong, with $5.6 billion in merchandise inventories at the end of the year, representing a 7% increase overall and 1.4% per store. They generated $2.9 billion in cash flow from operations and spent $1.1 billion on capital expenditures. The company repurchased 2.2 million shares of its common stock for $490 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per common share.

Looking ahead to 2022, Dollar General anticipates a 10% growth in net sales, 2.5% growth in same-store sales, and a 12% to 14% growth in earnings per share, despite ongoing cost inflation, supply chain challenges, and rising fuel costs. They plan to invest $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion in capital expenditures, increase their quarterly dividend by 31% to $0.55 per share, and repurchase approximately $2.75 billion of their common stock. The company remains optimistic about its business model and its ability to deliver strong financial performance in the future.
