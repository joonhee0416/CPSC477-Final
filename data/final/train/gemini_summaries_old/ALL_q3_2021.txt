Allstate Corporation experienced mixed financial results in the third quarter of 2021. While revenues surged by 16.9% to $12.5 billion, driven by National General's acquisition and higher net investment income, net income and adjusted net income declined year-over-year. The primary culprit for lower underwriting income was increased loss costs related to higher auto insurance claim severity resulting from supply chain disruptions. These disruptions caused significant increases in the prices of used cars and original equipment parts. To mitigate these challenges, Allstate implemented price increases to offset the sharp rise in loss costs.

Despite the underwriting challenges, Property-Liability policies in force increased by 12.5%, and Allstate reported strong growth in its Protection Plans and net written premium. Allstate Protection Plans and Arity contributed to higher revenue and increased policies in force. Net investment income also saw a boost, with performance-based income rising to $437 million.

The company's capital position remains strong, with significant cash returns to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Allstate also completed the divestitures of its Life Insurance Company and Life Insurance Company in New York, freeing up $1.7 billion for capital deployment.

Looking ahead, Allstate is focused on improving auto profitability through rate increases, claims effectiveness enhancements, and ongoing cost reductions. The company believes that maintaining an industry-leading auto insurance margin will enable it to deliver attractive returns to shareholders. Allstate's multi-year Transformative Growth initiative aims to increase market share and drive profitable growth by lowering costs, enhancing distribution, and investing in technology.
