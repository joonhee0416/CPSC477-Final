Murphy Oil reported a first-quarter net loss per share of $1.87, affected by non-cash impairment and mark-to-market losses. Despite the loss, the company achieved positive adjusted cash flow of $248 million, showcasing strong operational performance. Murphy's production beat guidance, with an average of 155,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (63% liquids). The onshore business contributed 80,000 barrels daily, while Eagle Ford Shale operations exceeded guidance despite winter storm impacts.

Financially, the company made significant progress on its debt reduction goals, with $233 million repaid in the first quarter. They are targeting an additional $200 million reduction by year-end, bringing the total to 15%. Murphy's execution remains top-notch, with offshore projects on schedule and onshore wells brought online ahead of time and under budget.

Furthermore, Murphy is actively advancing its exploration program. The Silverback well in the Gulf of Mexico is currently being drilled, and the Cutthroat well in Brazil is expected to be spud in the second half of 2021. The company's unique capabilities and ability to execute offshore projects faster than peers continue to be key advantages.

Overall, Murphy Oil remains focused on deleveraging, executing, and exploring. The company's strong production performance, improved cost efficiencies, and commitment to environmental sustainability position it well for future growth.
