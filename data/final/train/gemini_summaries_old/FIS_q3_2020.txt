In its third quarter, FIS returned to positive organic revenue growth, with revenue rising by 1% or $3.2 billion. This growth was primarily driven by increased recurring revenue in banking and capital markets, as well as improved trends in merchant transactions. Adjusted EBITDA also increased by 340 basis points sequentially to $1.4 billion. Margins expanded due to continued cost management, which outweighed a margin headwind from licensing. Banking revenue grew by 3% organically to $1.5 billion, while merchant revenue was flat at $1 billion. Capital markets revenue declined by 1% due to the timing of license renewals, but new sales for recurring revenue solutions increased by nearly 50%. FIS also highlighted its ongoing investments in new solutions, including Access Worldpay, ClearEdge, Ethos, and new partnerships for real-time payments. The company's backlog has also increased by 6% organically, and its pipeline is strong, providing momentum for continued revenue growth.
