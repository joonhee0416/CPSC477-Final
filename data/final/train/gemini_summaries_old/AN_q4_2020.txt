AutoNation reported record quarterly earnings with an adjusted EPS of $2.43, a 94% increase year-over-year. Same-store revenue grew 5% due to higher new and used vehicle revenue, despite a decline in customer care. Gross profit per vehicle increased significantly in both new and used vehicle sales. The company's SG&A expenses improved, resulting in a favorable margin. AutoNation plans to allocate capital towards store expansion, share repurchases, and acquisitions. They authorized an additional $1 billion share repurchase program, bringing the total available authorization to $1.1 billion. The company is committed to long-term growth, including an ambitious goal of retailing over 1 million combined new and used units annually.
