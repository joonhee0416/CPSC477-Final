In Q4 2021, SCI reported strong financial results with adjusted earnings per share of $1.17, a 4% increase year-over-year. Funeral revenue grew 9% driven by an 8.4% increase in the sales average, offsetting modest volume declines. Cemetery revenue grew 5%, primarily due to higher atneed sales and preneed merchandise and service growth. For the full year, revenue increased 18% to $632 million, and adjusted earnings per share grew 57% to $4.57. The company's focus on share repurchases and debt refinancing contributed to the earnings growth.

Looking ahead to 2022, SCI expects earnings per share growth of 20% at the midpoint, representing a 16.5% compounded annual growth rate over the 2019 pre-COVID base. This growth will be driven by the company's continued focus on operational efficiency, increased preneed sales, and strategic acquisitions. Funeral volume is expected to decline in the mid-teen percentage range due to the pull-forward effect of services during the pandemic, but remain flat compared to pre-COVID levels. Cemetery atneed revenue is also expected to decline, while preneed sales are projected to grow in the mid to high single digits. Beyond 2022, the company anticipates a return to more normalized growth in the 8% to 12% range as the pull-forward effect diminishes.
