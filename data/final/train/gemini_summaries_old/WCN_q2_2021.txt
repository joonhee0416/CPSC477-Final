Waste Connections reported strong Q2 results, with revenue increasing 17.5% year-over-year to $1.534 billion. Solid waste pricing volume growth exceeded expectations at 11.4%, driven by higher-than-expected volumes in regions heavily impacted by the pandemic. Recovered commodity values also contributed significantly, with a combined margin tailwind of 130 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA climbed 23%, supported by acquisition activity and commodity-driven margin expansion. Despite higher fuel and labor costs, a combination of incremental price increases and controlled discretionary spending resulted in margin expansion. Looking ahead, the company raised its full-year 2021 outlook, anticipating revenue growth of 5.975 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is now estimated to reach $1.875 billion, with a margin of 31.4%. The increased outlook is attributed to continued solid waste price and volume growth and higher recovered commodity values. The company's acquisition pipeline remains strong, with potential for further outsized activity driven by tax considerations. Waste Connections also announced plans to enhance shareholder returns through share repurchases and a potential double-digit increase in its quarterly cash dividend in October.
