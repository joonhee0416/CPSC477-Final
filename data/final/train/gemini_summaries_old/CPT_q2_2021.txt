Camden Property Trust experienced significant improvements across its operating fundamentals in the second quarter of 2021, driven by strong demand and pricing power. Same-property revenue growth reached 4.1%, with exceptional growth in Phoenix, Tampa, and other major markets. Rental rates surged, with new leases at 9.3% and renewals at 6.7% for a blended rate of 8%. July 2021 was particularly strong, with new signed leases at 18.7%, renewals at 10.5%, and a blended rate of 14.6%. Occupancy improved to 97.1%, while net turnover remained below historical levels despite aggressive pricing increases. The company's outlook for the apartment industry remains positive, as economists anticipate ongoing growth in the second half of 2021 and into 2022. Camden's expansion into Nashville with the acquisition of two high-quality apartment properties further demonstrates its focus on finding opportunities in a competitive environment. The company's financial performance was strong, with funds from operations (FFO) of $1.28 per share, exceeding guidance. Based on the positive operating performance, Camden revised its 2021 same-store guidance, increasing the midpoint of revenue growth and NOI guidance to 3.75%. Consequently, the company increased its full-year 2021 FFO guidance to $5.17 to $5.37 per share, with a midpoint of $5.27 per share.
