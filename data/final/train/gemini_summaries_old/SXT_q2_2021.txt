Sensient Technologies Corporation reported strong financial results for the second quarter, driven by growth across all business segments. The Flavors & Extracts Group posted 9% adjusted local currency revenue growth and 13% profit growth, benefiting from robust sales and a focus on value-added products. The Color Group rebounded with 7% revenue growth and 5% profit growth, fueled by success in both Food Colors and Personal Care. The Personal Care business, in particular, saw a strong recovery following headwinds experienced in 2020. The Asia Pacific Group delivered 11% revenue growth and 22% profit growth, driven by customer service, sales wins, and technology platform utilization. The company remains optimistic about its long-term prospects, expecting mid-single-digit revenue growth and margin improvement in the Flavors & Extracts and Color Groups, and mid-to-high single-digit revenue growth in Asia Pacific. Sensient expects to exceed the top end of its previously issued 2021 guidance, with mid-single-digit adjusted local currency growth in revenue and EBITDA. The company also completed an acquisition in the quarter and is actively seeking further opportunities to support its strategic initiatives.
