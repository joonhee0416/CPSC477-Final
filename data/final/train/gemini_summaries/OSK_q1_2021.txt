In Q1 2021, Oshkosh Corp. reported sales of nearly $1.6 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.13, exceeding expectations. Despite challenges related to COVID-19, the company's focus on cost control and operational efficiency led to higher sales in its Defense and Fire & Emergency segments. The Access Equipment segment continues to face decline due to COVID-19, but the company anticipates improvement in Q3. The Commercial segment saw progress in simplification initiatives and is expecting revenue growth in 2021. Oshkosh recently acquired Pratt Miller, a technology company that will support new product development. The company is closely monitoring supply chain risks and rising steel prices. While no quantitative expectations for 2021 were provided, Oshkosh is optimistic about opportunities for sales and earnings growth as markets recover.
