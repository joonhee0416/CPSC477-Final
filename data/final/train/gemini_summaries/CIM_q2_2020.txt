Chimera Investment Corporation navigated the volatile first half of 2020 by retaining its high-yielding mortgage credit portfolio and executing strategic transactions. The company has materially reduced its mark-to-market risk through non-mark-to-market repo finance facilities and long-term loan securitizations. Chimera's legacy portfolio and the current low interest rate environment provide opportunities for continued spread income and dividend payments. The company successfully executed three securitizations totaling over $1 billion, retaining subordinate tranches with attractive yields and potential for appreciation. Chimera sees ample supply of loans for sale from GSEs and banks, creating investment opportunities. The company's financial highlights include a core earnings per share of $0.32 in Q2, a GAAP loss per share of $0.37, and a book value per common share of $10.63. Chimera's strong balance sheet, favorable financing terms, and available cash position it for growth in the challenging market conditions.
