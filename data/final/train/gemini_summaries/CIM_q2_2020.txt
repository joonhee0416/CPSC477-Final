Chimera Investment Corp. navigated market volatility in the first half of 2020 and retained its high-yielding mortgage credit portfolio, which has become more valuable due to the Federal Reserve's asset purchases and low interest rates. Chimera executed three securitizations totaling over $1 billion, reducing warehouse exposure and reopening the mortgage securitization market. The company secured longer-term and non-mark-to-market repo finance facilities, increasing its resilience to volatility. Chimera's core earnings per share were $0.32 in Q2, with a net interest spread of 2.4% and total leverage of 4.3:1. The company retained the subordinate tranches from securitizations, providing potential for appreciation in a normalized market. Chimera believes attractive opportunities exist in the residential loan market and plans to continue creating high-yielding investments through securitization. The company's strong liquidity and unencumbered assets position it well for the future.
