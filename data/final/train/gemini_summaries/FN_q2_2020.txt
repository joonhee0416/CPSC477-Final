Fabrinet reported a strong Q2 with record quarterly revenue of $426 million, exceeding guidance metrics. Optical communications revenue increased 6% sequentially, driven by growth in telecom and datacom segments. Non-optical communications revenue also surpassed expectations, with industrial laser revenue improving. Despite a foreign exchange headwind, non-GAAP net income came in at $1 per share, exceeding the guidance range. For Q3, Fabrinet anticipates a revenue range of $410-418 million, moderating more than usual due to the coronavirus outbreak in China. Non-GAAP net income per share for Q3 is expected to be $0.92-0.95 and GAAP net income per share is estimated at $0.75-0.78. Looking ahead, Fabrinet is excited about its business momentum and remains optimistic about its ability to drive shareholder value over the long term.
