Ameriprise delivered another strong quarter with adjusted operating earnings per share up 39% to $5.27, driven by robust growth in its core businesses of Advice and Wealth Management (AWM) and Asset Management. AWM posted a 29% increase in adjusted operating net revenues and a 56% increase in pre-tax adjusted operating earnings, fueled by strong client flows ($9.5 billion) and a 14% increase in advisor productivity. Asset Management achieved strong inflows ($6.7 billion), resulting in a 32% increase in adjusted operating revenues and a 79% increase in pre-tax adjusted operating earnings. The company remains committed to managing expenses effectively, with G&A expenses increasing by 6% in AWM and 12% in Asset Management. Ameriprise continues to execute its strategic priorities by expanding its growth businesses (BMO acquisition) and reducing its risk profile (reinsurance of fixed annuities). Overall, the company's financial performance underscores the strength of its business model, with a 37.5% adjusted operating return on equity and a strong balance sheet with excess capital of $2 billion.
