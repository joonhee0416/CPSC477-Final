Emerson reported strong financial performance in the second quarter, driven by robust demand and the benefits of cost reset initiatives. Adjusted earnings per share reached $0.97, exceeding expectations despite a significant headwind from stock compensation. Underlying sales growth came in at 2%, with Automation Solutions improving and Commercial & Residential Solutions experiencing continued strong demand. The cost reset program, implemented two years ago, yielded significant benefits, increasing adjusted segment EBIT by 15% and margin by 150 basis points. Cash flow also remained strong, with operating cash flow up 37% year-over-year and free cash flow up 48%.

Emerson saw positive trends in orders, with a trailing three-month increase of 4% in March. Automation Solutions continued its recovery, with orders and sales improving. Commercial & Residential Solutions experienced exceptional growth, driven by residential end markets, cold chain, professional tools, and other commercial and industrial markets.

Looking ahead, Emerson is optimistic about the remainder of 2021. Sales projections have been increased to a range of 3% to 6% for the full year, with Automation Solutions expected to remain flat and Commercial & Residential Solutions projected to grow 12% to 14%. The company expects to achieve an adjusted EBIT margin of 17.5% for the enterprise. Cash flow projections have also been revised upward to $3.3 billion in operating cash flow and $2.7 billion in free cash flow.

Emerson remains confident in its long-term strategy and is well-positioned to capture market opportunities in the post-pandemic recovery. The company is leveraging its cost reset efforts, technology investments, and customer-centric approach to drive continued growth and profitability.
