Emerson reported its second quarter earnings, surpassing expectations with adjusted earnings per share of $0.97, a 9% increase year-over-year. Despite challenges from unprecedented input cost increases and elevated stock compensation, the company raised its full-year guidance to $3.90 plus or minus $0.05 in adjusted earnings per share. Underlying sales grew 2% in the quarter, driven by robust demand in Commercial & Residential Solutions (11% growth) and early signs of recovery in Automation Solutions. The company's cost reset program continues to deliver benefits, with adjusted segment EBIT increasing 15% and margins expanding to 19.1%. Cash flow remains strong, with operating cash flow and free cash flow both increasing. Emerson remains optimistic about the second half of the year, expecting growth in the high single-digits range and continued momentum in key markets.
