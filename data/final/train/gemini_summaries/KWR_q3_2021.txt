Quaker Houghton reported a strong quarter, exceeding expectations with 22% sales growth to $449.1 million. Organic volume growth of 6%, pricing initiatives (10%), acquisitions (4%), and foreign exchange (2%) contributed to this increase. Despite sequential flat volumes, pricing initiatives offset raw material headwinds, which increased nearly 10% from Q2 to Q3. However, higher input costs impacted gross margins, leading to a decline to 32.3%. The company expects sequential improvement in Q4 margins as price increases offset raw material inflation. Adjusted EBITDA of $66.2 million increased 3% year-over-year, and the trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA reached a record $279 million. Quaker Houghton continues to pursue acquisitions with recent purchases adding $15 million in revenue on a multiple of approximately seven to eight times EBITDA. Looking ahead, despite headwinds from raw material costs, the semiconductor shortage, and power restrictions in China, the company anticipates a strong 2022 driven by end-market growth, market share gains, and margin improvement.
