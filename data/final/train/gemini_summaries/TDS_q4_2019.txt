In 2019, TDS Telecom maintained a strong foundation for growth by investing significantly in fiber deployments, cable acquisitions, and network upgrades. These investments have fueled increased broadband penetration and video connections, leading to a 1% revenue growth to $4 billion. Despite increased data usage, total cash expenses rose only 1%, demonstrating cost-effective network management. Adjusted operating income and EBITDA grew 5%, reaching $775 million and $950 million, respectively. For 2020, the company anticipates low-single-digit revenue growth and adjusted operating income between $775 million and $900 million due to continued network investments and cost-saving initiatives. Capital expenditures are projected to increase to $850-950 million to support 5G deployment and network modernization. The company's transformation is well underway, with a focus on enhancing customer experiences and meeting the growing demand for data and faster speeds.
