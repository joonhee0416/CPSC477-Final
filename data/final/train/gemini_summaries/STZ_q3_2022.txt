Constellation's Q3 performance was marked by strong beer sales, particularly Modelo and Corona brands, resulting in an 80% depletion growth rate and net sales growth guidance of 10-11% for fiscal 2022. To support this growth, Constellation plans to invest $5-5.5 billion over the next four fiscal years to expand its Mexican beer capacity. Despite ongoing challenges, the Wine and Spirits business remains focused on revenue growth and margin expansion, with an organic net sales growth guidance increase to 4-6%. Overall, strong total company performance has led to an increase in comparable basis earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2022 to $10.50-$10.65. Additionally, Constellation announced a new agreement with Coca-Cola to bring the FRESCA brand into beverage alcohol with a line of mixed cocktails using real spirits.
