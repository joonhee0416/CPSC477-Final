Greenbrier's business is recovering, with Q3 marking a significant improvement over the first half of fiscal 2021. The company's strategy, including cost-cutting measures and a focus on employee safety, has strengthened its position in the market. Orders for new railcars have increased significantly, with a total backlog of 24,800 units valued at $2.6 billion as of May 31st. This backlog demonstrates robust demand across segments like intermodal and grain covered hoppers, supported by increased rail traffic and reduced car storage. Despite rising steel prices, Greenbrier's manufacturing efficiency is improving, with Q3 deliveries increasing by 57% from Q2. Additionally, the company's leasing and services business is expanding through the formation of GBX Leasing, creating a new revenue stream. With a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity, Greenbrier is well-positioned to navigate the current market conditions and support its growth trajectory.
