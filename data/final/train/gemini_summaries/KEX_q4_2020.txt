Kirby Corporation reported fourth-quarter earnings per share of $0.37, impacted by the pandemic's reduced demand for transportation services. Marine Transportation revenues declined 7% sequentially, with inland barge utilization falling into the high 60% range due to weak refinery utilization and hurricanes. Coastal barge utilization remained in the mid-70% range, while demand for refined products and black oil remained low. Distribution and Services revenues improved 8% sequentially, driven by commercial and industrial growth. Despite challenges in crewing vessels and competitive pricing dynamics, Kirby anticipates improved utilization levels and a second-half recovery in both Marine Transportation and Distribution and Services. Long-term market conditions in inland marine transportation are expected to improve, with barge utilization projected to reach the high 80% to low 90% range by year-end. The company anticipates a more robust economy and increased oilfield activity in 2021, resulting in improved demand and strong cash flow generation, which will be used to pay down debt and enhance liquidity.
