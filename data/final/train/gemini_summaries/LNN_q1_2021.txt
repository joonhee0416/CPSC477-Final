The company reported a 12% decline in first-quarter earnings per share to $0.65, missing Refinitiv IBES estimates of $0.77. Total revenues dropped slightly to $108.5 million, primarily due to a decrease in infrastructure segment revenues. However, the irrigation segment saw a 5% increase in revenues, driven by higher unit sales volumes in international markets, resulting in a 9% increase in operating income. Despite an increase in raw material and freight costs, the irrigation segment's operating margin improved to 12.2%. The infrastructure segment's operating margin declined to 20.1% from 33.5% due to lower revenue and higher costs. Cash flow increased by 138% to $10 million, and total available liquidity stands at $196.4 million. The company expects ongoing margin headwinds in the second quarter due to increased costs but anticipates improved activity levels in international irrigation markets.
