Guess? reported strong third-quarter results, exceeding top-line expectations with adjusted earnings per share of $0.58 versus last year's $0.22. Despite an 8% revenue decline, the company achieved a 9.7% adjusted operating margin, a significant 600 basis point expansion. Notably, the European business contributed heavily to this growth, showing a 16% revenue increase and an impressive 900 basis point margin expansion. Key product categories such as essentials, activewear, and accessories performed well and helped mitigate overall business declines.

Guess? is strategically positioned for the holiday season, although it anticipates store traffic challenges. E-commerce is expected to partially offset these declines. Meanwhile, the company faces temporary government-mandated store closures in Europe and Canada, which will impact revenue. Additionally, a shift in wholesale shipments in Europe has resulted in a smaller portion of spring-summer collection shipments in Q4 compared to last year.

Despite current challenges, Guess? remains confident in its long-term strategic initiatives, including its global brand elevation, improved customer experience, and organizational development strategy. The company has rolled out a one-global-line-of-product initiative to improve product development efficiency and consistency. Significant progress has been made in implementing the Salesforce platform and Customer 360 suite, enhancing customer engagement and personalization. Finally, Guess? expects to complete its global organizational development strategy by next year, targeting cost optimization and performance enhancements.
