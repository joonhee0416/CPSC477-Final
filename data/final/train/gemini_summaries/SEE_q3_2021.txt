In Q3, SEE's net sales increased 14% to $1.4 billion, led by 13% growth in Foods and 12% growth in Protective segments. Volume growth was 5%, with price realization of 8%. Despite this, adjusted EBITDA rose only 4% to $271 million, as inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions constrained margins to 19.2%. Adjusted earnings per share increased from $0.82 to $0.86. For the full year, SEE raised its sales estimate to approximately $5.5 billion, a 12% increase, and narrowed its adjusted EBITDA guidance to $1.12-$1.14 billion. Adjusted EPS is now expected to be $3.50-$3.60. Free cash flow is projected to range from $520-$540 million.

SEE's success is driven by its focus on Touchless Automation, Digital, and Sustainability. Sales in its Automation portfolio are up 20% year-to-date, led by its Autobag Systems and protein automation solutions. Digital solutions, through SEE Mark Smart Packaging, enhance connectivity and drive operational savings. In Sustainability, SEE aims to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 and has designed 50% of its solutions for recyclability.

SEE is investing heavily in Touchless Automation, with a target of over $750 million in sales by 2025. This includes expanding equipment capacity and investing in smart packaging and digital printing. Additionally, SEE is returning value to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, and has strengthened its capital structure with a $600 million secured bond issuance.
