Sonic Automotive reported a strong Q1 2021 with record revenue of $2.8 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.23, up from $0.40 in Q1 2020. Franchise dealerships contributed significantly to this growth, with revenues increasing 15% and pre-tax income tripling. EchoPark, Sonic's pre-owned car business, also achieved record quarterly revenues of $507 million, representing a 53% increase year-over-year, driven by strong demand and an expanded inventory selection. The company's expense structure has improved significantly, with total SG&A expenses decreasing as a percentage of gross profit. Sonic continues to expand its EchoPark network and expects to open 25 new locations in 2021, bringing its nationwide distribution network to over 140 points by 2025. With increased liquidity and a stronger credit facility, the company has also increased its quarterly cash dividend by 20% to $0.12 per share and expanded its share repurchase authorization to $277 million.
