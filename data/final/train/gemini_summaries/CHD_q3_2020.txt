Church & Dwight's third quarter was marked by a 13.9% increase in revenue, driven by organic sales growth of 9.9% and increased consumption across various categories. The company's agility during the pandemic, including increased marketing communication and investment in essential products, has contributed to these positive results. Q3 adjusted earnings per share grew 6.1% to $0.70, exceeding expectations. Furthermore, the full year outlook has been revised, with sales growth now expected to be approximately 11%, organic sales growth at 9%, and adjusted earnings per share growth of 13%-14%. VITAFUSION and L'IL CRITTERS gummy vitamins, along with ARM & HAMMER products, led the growth. E-commerce sales also saw a significant increase of 77%, with the full year expected to reach 13%. Despite the pandemic's impact on some categories like BATISTE dry shampoo and TROJAN condoms, the company remains optimistic, citing strong fundamentals, a balance of value and premium products, and low exposure to private label. Church & Dwight also plans to increase its marketing spend and make incremental investments in the second half of the year. With a strong balance sheet and the ability to acquire TSR-accretive businesses, the company is confident in its ability to perform well in both good and bad economic times.
