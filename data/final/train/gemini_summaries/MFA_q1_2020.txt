MFA experienced a significant first-quarter loss of $914 million due to asset impairments and margin calls amid the market turmoil caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, the company has focused on balance sheet management, liquidity improvement, and third-party capital sourcing. Through negotiations with Apollo and Athene, MFA has secured $500 million in senior secured notes and a committed term borrowing facility of approximately $1.65 billion, providing non-mark-to-market financing for its loan portfolio. This strategic partnership also includes the acquisition of MFA common stock by Apollo and Athene and the appointment of an observer to the Board of Directors. With these transactions, MFA expects to satisfy margin calls, exit its forbearance agreement, and resume dividend payments on preferred stock. The company's portfolio has transitioned to primarily whole loans, which will be financed through term non-mark-to-market arrangements. Book value as of May 31 is estimated to have increased slightly, driven by loan mark appreciation, while economic book value remains flat. MFA is optimistic about its capital raise and strategic partnership, enabling them to pursue investment opportunities and enhance downside protection.
