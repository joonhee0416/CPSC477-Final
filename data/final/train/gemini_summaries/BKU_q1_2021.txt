BankUnited reported strong financial performance in the first quarter, with a solid net income of $99 million and an earnings per share of $1.06. The company's deposit strategy has been successful, leading to significant growth in noninterest-bearing demand deposits (NIDA) and a decline in cost of deposits. Despite elevated liquidity levels, net interest income increased due to NIM expansion resulting from the deposit strategy. Loan growth was impacted by a decline in line utilization, but the company anticipates improvement as the economy recovers. Credit quality remained stable, with a decline in charge-offs and criticized and classified assets. The company has a strong capital position, with CET1 ratios of 13.2% and 14.8% for the holding company and bank, respectively. The company declared a dividend of $0.23 per share and plans to maintain this level. The company is also making progress on revenue initiatives, including treasury management and commercial card programs. The overall outlook for the remainder of 2021 is positive, with continued deposit growth, NIM expansion, and mid-single-digit growth in net interest income excluding securities gains.
