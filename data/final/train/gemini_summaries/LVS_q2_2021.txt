Despite ongoing pandemic impacts, Las Vegas Sands reported positive EBITDA of $244 million per quarter, showing sequential improvement in Macao. The company remains optimistic about recovery in both Macao and Singapore, but the timing remains uncertain. Singapore's performance was impacted by pandemic restrictions, and the closure of Marina Bay Sands (MBS) from August 1st to 5th will negatively affect Q3 results. Despite these challenges, significant investments in Macao and the strong spending at the premium mass level have fueled optimism for a return to pre-pandemic EBITDA levels. The sale of Las Vegas assets has created liquidity and options for exploring new destination resorts in the U.S. and Asia. The company is also exploring digital opportunities and expects to update shareholders in the future.
