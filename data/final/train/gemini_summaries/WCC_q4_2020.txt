In 2020, WESCO (the combined entity after acquiring Anixter) reported robust financial results and made significant progress in integrating both businesses. The company generated $586 million in free cash flow and reduced net debt by $389 million. Additionally, WESCO increased its three-year post-merger cost synergy target from $200 million to $250 million, with $39 million realized in the first six months after closing. Sales rose 4% in Q4 on a workday-adjusted basis, and January sales showed low single-digit growth year-over-year. Gross margin improved 10 basis points year-over-year to 19.6%. The integration with Anixter is progressing well, with synergies expected to drive $90 million in additional realized cost savings in 2021. Furthermore, WESCO is well-positioned to benefit from secular growth trends in electrical, communication, security, and utility solutions. The company projects sales growth of 3% to 6% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 5.4% to 5.7% in 2021, supported by market outperformance, operating leverage, and cost synergies.
