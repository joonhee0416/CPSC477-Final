In 2020, Watts successfully mitigated COVID-19 headwinds, maintaining operating margins and investing in long-term growth despite a 6% sales decline. The company executed cost-cutting measures totaling $55 million, invested heavily in new products and Smart & Connected initiatives, and strengthened its balance sheet. For 2021, Watts anticipates continued challenges from COVID-19, potential air pockets in non-residential and multifamily construction starting in Q2, geopolitical concerns, commodity inflation, and returning costs suspended in 2020. However, the company expects to benefit from growth in residential construction, new product introductions, Smart & Connected sales, productivity improvements, and incremental savings from previous cost actions. The company's full-year outlook includes organic sales potentially ranging from down 5% to flat, adjusted operating margin contraction of 50-90 basis points, strong free cash flow conversion, and continued investments in R&D and acquisitions. Watts remains confident in its ability to navigate near-term COVID-19 challenges while executing on its long-term growth strategy.
