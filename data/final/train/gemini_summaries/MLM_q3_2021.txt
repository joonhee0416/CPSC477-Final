Martin Marietta's Q3 2021 performance showcased record revenues, gross profit, and adjusted EBITDA, with adjusted EBITDA increasing 7% year-to-date to $1.1 billion. The integration of Lehigh Hanson's West Region is progressing smoothly, and the company is well-positioned to benefit from favorable market dynamics in California and Arizona. Martin Marietta continued to experience growing product demand, with organic aggregate shipments increasing 6%, driven by strong underlying demand and a low-priced excess fuel product. While energy costs increased by nearly 50% year-over-year, Martin Marietta implemented midyear price increases in the Carolinas and Texas, and anticipates meaningful pricing acceleration in 2022. Supported by strong domestic steel production and global demand, Magnesia Specialties also generated revenue growth and improved product gross margin. The company raised its full-year capital spending guidance to include Lehigh West expenditures and increased its quarterly cash dividend by 7%. With its nationwide footprint, Martin Marietta is poised to capitalize on infrastructure investments, single-family housing strength, and nonresidential recovery, expecting organic aggregate shipments and pricing to increase significantly in 2022.
