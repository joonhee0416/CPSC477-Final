Comerica reported a solid performance in 2020, navigating challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite ultra-low interest rates, the bank's financial results were buoyed by solid loan performance, strong deposit growth, and effective expense management. Net income for the fourth quarter reached $215 million, a 3% increase from the third quarter.

Loan growth continued throughout the year, with an increase in December compared to November, and a pipeline that reached pre-COVID levels. Deposits hit a new all-time high, driven by non-interest-bearing accounts. The bank remained disciplined in its expenses, managing costs effectively while investing in future developments.

Credit quality remained strong, with net charge-offs at 22 basis points. The bank maintained a high credit reserve, which it believes will help manage economic uncertainty. Non-interest income increased, driven by customer activity and strong fee income.

In the first quarter of 2021, the bank expects National Dealer loans to increase, offset by a decline in Mortgage Banker loans. Net interest income is projected to be lower due to reduced loan balances, lower security yields, and fewer days in the quarter. Net charge-offs are expected to increase, but the bank believes its credit reserve will mitigate the impact.

While economic conditions remain uncertain, Comerica remains confident in its ability to thrive in the recovery. The bank emphasizes its long history of managing challenges, its strong capital base, and its commitment to delivering long-term shareholder value.
