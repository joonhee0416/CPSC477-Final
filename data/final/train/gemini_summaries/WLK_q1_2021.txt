Westlake Chemical OpCo LP reported a strong first quarter of 2021, highlighted by a 154% increase in operating income compared to the pre-pandemic first quarter of 2020. This growth was attributed to robust global demand, tight inventory conditions, and production outages due to severe weather. The Vinyls segment benefited from increased PVC resin prices and strong downstream building products demand, while the Olefins segment saw higher polyethylene pricing and margins driven by global packaging and domestic production issues. Despite the negative impact of the winter storm, which resulted in lost sales and higher costs, net income increased by $97 million year-over-year, primarily due to higher sales prices, integrated margins, and strong demand for downstream building products. The company expects continued strength in demand for polyethylene, PVC, and building products, supported by solid residential construction, packaging, automotive, and healthcare markets. Westlake's operations remain cost-competitive, and its focus on sustainability and corporate social responsibility continues, as evidenced by the introduction of "GreenVin" green caustic soda.
