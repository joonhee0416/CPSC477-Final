Baxter International delivered strong third-quarter results, with revenue increasing 9% to $3.2 billion and adjusted earnings per share exceeding guidance at $1.02, up 23%. The acquisition of Hillrom, pending regulatory approval, is expected to further enhance Baxter's offerings.

BioPharma Solutions led growth with 45% constant currency growth, driven by COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing revenue. Medication Delivery grew 11%, benefiting from improved hospital admissions and new infusion pump contracts. Pharmaceuticals sales increased 7% after adjusting for an acquisition, driven by international pharmacy compounding.

Renal Care experienced mixed results, with home PD product growth offset by lower in-center and clinical sales. Advanced Surgery and Acute Therapies performed well, despite lower U.S. surgical volumes in Advanced Surgery.

Baxter remains optimistic about the long-term growth trajectory but acknowledges uncertainty due to the pandemic and macroeconomic factors. For full-year 2021, the company anticipates sales growth of 7-8% and adjusted earnings per share of $3.58-$3.62, excluding special items. The fourth quarter is expected to see sales growth of 3-4% and adjusted earnings per share of $1.00-$1.04.
