In 2020, CNO achieved strong financial performance, with a 37% increase in operating earnings per share, $387 million in free cash flow, and $330 million returned to shareholders. The company completed the acquisition of DirectPath, expanding its Worksite capabilities and diversifying its revenue base. Despite COVID-19 challenges, Worksite revenue remained stable, while premium persistency increased. In the Consumer division, direct-to-consumer life sales grew by 10%, supported by D2C conversions driving two-thirds of exclusive field agent sales growth. The company also launched myHealthPolicy.com to enhance its Medicare offerings. Quarterly operating earnings per share rose by 17%, driven by strong health margins due to deferred medical care and robust alternative investment earnings. The company's full-year operating return on equity excluding significant items was 12%. Despite increased expenses and lower fee income, healthy levels of free cash flow and excess capital position CNO for ongoing share repurchase activity and investments in growth initiatives. Looking ahead, CNO expects modestly favorable COVID-related impacts in the first half of 2021, offsetting impacts from lower investment income and continued low interest rates.
