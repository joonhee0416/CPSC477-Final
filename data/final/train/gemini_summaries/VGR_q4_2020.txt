In Q4 2020, Vector Group's revenue surged by $115 million, reaching $554.6 million, with contributions from both its Tobacco and Real Estate segments. The company's adjusted EBITDA also rose significantly to $93.4 million from $52.5 million in the prior year's quarter. Adjusted net income amounted to $32.6 million, marking a substantial increase from $17.8 million in Q4 2019. For the full year 2020, Vector Group's adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income both witnessed notable gains. Regarding Douglas Elliman, its Q4 2020 revenues reached $267.5 million, while its operating and administrative expenses decreased by approximately $7.9 million compared to Q4 2019. Vector Group's tobacco operations performed strongly in Q4, with revenue increases and margin growth contributing to a 33% increase in adjusted operating income. Liggett's increased earnings were driven by higher gross profit margins associated with increased volumes, high net pricing, and lower per unit MSA expenses. Despite a slight decline in retail share, Liggett's Eagle 20s brand remains a top-performing discount brand in the U.S. To further strengthen its position in the deep discount segment, Vector Group expanded the distribution of its Montego brand to additional states and has seen positive initial results. Overall, Vector Group's strong cash reserves, consistent tobacco market share growth, and proactive measures taken to position Douglas Elliman for future success position the company well for continued growth and value for shareholders.
