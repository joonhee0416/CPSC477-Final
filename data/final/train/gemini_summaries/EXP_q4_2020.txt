Eagle Materials reported record quarterly revenue in its fourth fiscal quarter, driven by increased Cement and Wallboard sales volume. Despite the impact of COVID-19, the company's essential business status allowed it to remain open safely, contributing to a strong end to its fiscal year. Eagle Materials' proactive safety measures prioritized employee well-being and customer confidence. Given the uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, the company emphasizes rapid feedback groups and local market agility. To conserve cash, Eagle Materials has suspended its dividend, curtailed nonessential capital expenditures, and managed inventory levels. Additionally, it has sold non-core assets, including its frac sand distribution business and California Concrete and Aggregates assets. Despite the challenges in the Oil and Gas Proppants sector, Eagle Materials remains well-positioned with a strong balance sheet and plans to capitalize on opportunities in the wake of the pandemic. The company's strategic network of plants, recent Kosmos Cement acquisition, and expanded Republic Paper capacity reinforce its commitment to long-term growth.
