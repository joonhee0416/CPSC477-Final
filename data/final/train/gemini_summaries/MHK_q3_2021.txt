Mohawk Industries exceeded expectations with Q3 net sales growth of 9% to $2.8 billion, driven by pricing and mix actions. Adjusted earnings per share reached $3.95. Despite headwinds from COVID-19, supply chain disruptions, and material constraints, sales remained strong in most regions. Home and commercial sectors saw growth, with price and mix actions offsetting inflationary pressures. The company's focus on flexibility, operational efficiency, and cost optimization contributed to improved margins. However, ongoing supply challenges, particularly in LVT, carpet, laminate, and board panels, have impacted production. Additionally, natural gas price increases in Europe are expected to negatively impact Ceramic Europe for the fourth quarter. Mohawk continues to invest in capacity expansion, new product development, and sales and service support. Looking ahead, the company anticipates a more typical seasonal Q4 and estimates adjusted EPS of $2.80 to $2.90, excluding restructuring charges.
