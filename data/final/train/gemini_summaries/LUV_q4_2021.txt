Southwest Airlines (Southwest) reported a profitable fourth quarter of 2021 despite the challenges of the omicron variant and winter weather. Driven by strong leisure and business travel demand, the company achieved an adjusted net income of $85 million or $0.14 per diluted share.

Although Omicron impacted January and February, Southwest expects to return to profitability in March and for the full year 2022. To mitigate staffing shortages caused by the variant, Southwest extended incentive pay programs for operations employees through early February. Additionally, the company has increased starting wage rates to enhance hiring efforts.

Southwest has adjusted its capacity plans for 2022, reducing its full-year capacity outlook by 4% compared to 2019 levels. This reflects a more conservative approach in light of the Omicron disruption. The company's goal remains to restore its network and improve operational reliability and efficiency by the end of 2023.

Despite the near-term challenges, Southwest remains optimistic about its long-term strategy and the underlying competitive advantages of its business model. Ongoing initiatives, including a new co-brand credit card agreement, GDS expansion, and revenue management system optimization, are expected to drive significant value in the coming years.
