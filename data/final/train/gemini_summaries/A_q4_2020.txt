Agilent Technologies reported strong fourth-quarter results, exceeding expectations with an 8% increase in revenue to $1.48 billion. This growth was driven by robust performance across all segments, including double-digit growth in the pharmaceutical and food markets. Notably, the chemical and energy business also exceeded expectations, returning to growth after two quarters of decline. Operating margins remained strong at 24.9%, despite incremental investments in marketing and R&D. For the full year, revenue grew 3% to $5.34 billion, supported by resilient recurring businesses and a return to growth in the instrument business. Agilent maintained a strong financial position, generating operating cash flow of $377 million in the quarter and repurchasing shares worth $250 million. Looking ahead, the company provided guidance for 2021 with expected revenue growth of 5% to 7% and double-digit growth in non-GAAP earnings per share. However, Agilent adopted a cautious approach to its first-quarter outlook due to ongoing COVID-19 uncertainties, estimating revenue growth in the range of 4.5% to 5.5%.
