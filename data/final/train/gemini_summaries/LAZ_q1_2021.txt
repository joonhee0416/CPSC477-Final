Lazard reported a 15% rise in first-quarter revenue to $648 million, driven by gains in both Financial Advisory and Asset Management. Financial Advisory revenue increased 8% to $317 million, reflecting robust activity in M&A, particularly in the $1 billion to $10 billion range and in Europe. Asset Management revenue surged 22% to $328 million, boosted by management fees on a larger AUM base and strong incentive fees. As of March 31, AUM reached a record $265 billion, a 37% increase year-over-year, driven by market appreciation and inflows in convertibles, international, and global equities. The company continues to invest in growth areas in Asset Management, such as ESG and alternative strategies. Looking ahead, Lazard anticipates increased transaction closings in Financial Advisory and favorable market conditions for global active management in Asset Management, driven by strong economic forecasts, technology disruptions, and shareholder activism. The company is well-positioned to benefit from these tailwinds with its large AUM and diverse strategy offerings.
