Vulcan Materials reported $418 million in adjusted EBITDA, up 4% year-over-year. However, profitability was impacted by cost pressures such as energy inflation ($30 million headwind), higher diesel prices ($14 million expense), and increased liquid asphalt costs ($16 million). Despite these headwinds, aggregate gross profit per ton improved by 3% to $7.74. Total aggregate volume increased by 8%, including U.S. Concrete contributions. Same-store aggregate volumes grew by 5% and prices by 3.1%, with year-over-year average selling prices increasing sequentially. Operating efficiencies offset some of the higher input costs, with same-store aggregate cost of sales rising by only 1.7% year-over-year (or decreasing by 1% excluding diesel). Asphalt profitability declined due to higher costs and wet weather. Concrete gross profit increased by 18% due to U.S. Concrete ownership, while same-store volumes decreased by 7% and prices increased by 2%. Demand improvement was observed across all end markets, with residential end-use showing strength and nonresidential end market leading indicators improving. Looking forward, Vulcan expects 2022 pricing increases of at least 5% and targets $50 million in synergies from the U.S. Concrete acquisition.
