During Q1 '21, Frontline, with its fleet of modern, spot-exposed tankers, reported a net income of $28.9 million ($0.15 per share) despite a challenging market. The company's conservative charter strategy, emphasizing long voyages for potential long-term gain, proved successful, with VLCCs earning $19,000/day, Suezmaxes $15,000/day, and LR2s $12,000/day. In the second quarter, Frontline anticipates lower spot TCE rates due to ballast days at the quarter-end and lower freight rates. The company's balance sheet shows a $10 million increase since Q4 '20, with cash and equivalents of $318 million. Frontline's all-in cash breakeven rate is estimated at $18,100/day for its fleet, while opex was reported at $7,300/day for VLCCs, $7,100/day for Suezmaxes, and $7,200/day for LR2s. The tanker industry faces a positive outlook, with asset prices on the rise, recycling rates low, a shrinking order book, and a tightening supply-demand balance, supporting investments in modern, fuel-efficient vessels like those in Frontline's fleet.
