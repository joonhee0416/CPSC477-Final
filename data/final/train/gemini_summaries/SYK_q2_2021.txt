Stryker reported a strong second quarter with organic sales growth of 9.3%, driven by double-digit growth in Neurovascular, Mako, emergency care, sports medicine, and U.S. shoulder and total ankle products. International organic growth outpaced the U.S. at 14.2%, with excellent results in various regions. Despite COVID challenges, elective procedures continued to recover with both hips and knees showing sequential improvement and returning to growth. The company is confident in the full year outlook, increasing its organic sales guidance to 9%-10% and raising its adjusted earnings per share guidance to $9.25-$9.40. Integration of Wright Medical is progressing well, with cross-selling expected to ramp up in the second half of the year. Ongoing execution on margins and continued progress on Wright Medical integration have contributed to the raised guidance.
