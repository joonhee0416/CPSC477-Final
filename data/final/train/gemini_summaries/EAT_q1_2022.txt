Despite staffing and supply chain challenges, Brinker reported solid top-line performance in the first quarter, with total revenues of $860 million and consolidated comp sales of 17%, driven by an 11% increase in traffic. However, headwinds from commodity costs and labor-related expenses negatively impacted margins, resulting in an adjusted earnings per share of $0.34. To offset these costs, Brinker implemented price increases and projects a total price increase of 3% at Chili's following their next menu update. While transitory costs related to training and overtime are expected to improve in the next couple of quarters, the company assumes continued challenges in the near term. Despite these challenges, Brinker remains optimistic about the future, with plans to reduce leverage ratios and implement strategic initiatives to drive traffic and organic top-line growth. The company maintains its fiscal year guidance of annual revenues between $3.75 billion and $3.85 billion and adjusted earnings per share between $3.50 and $3.80, assuming no significant top-line COVID-related disruptions.
