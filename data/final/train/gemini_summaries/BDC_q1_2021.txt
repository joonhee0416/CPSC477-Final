Belden exceeded expectations in Q1 2021 with $536 million in revenue, a 16% increase year-over-year. Demand trends are improving, leading to a healthy book-to-bill ratio of 1.3 times. Organic growth was 8%, driven by strong performance in both the Industrial Solutions and Enterprise Solutions segments. EBITDA increased 32% to $80 million, expanding margins by 180 basis points. The company acquired OTN Systems in January, whose offerings complement Belden's industrial networking portfolio. In order to focus on high-growth markets, Belden is divesting certain underperforming product lines and is exiting the oil and gas and some Smart Buildings markets. The company remains committed to driving innovation, investing in its product roadmap, and improving software content in its offerings. Belden is also sharpening its commercial excellence by enhancing its solution selling capabilities and opening customer innovation centers around the world. With an increased revenue and earnings per share outlook for 2021, Belden is confident in its ability to accelerate organic growth, expand margins, and delever the balance sheet.
