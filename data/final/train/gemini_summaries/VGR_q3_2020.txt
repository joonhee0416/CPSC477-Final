Vector Group's Q3 2020 performance was positive, with revenue increasing to $547.8 million, primarily due to growth in both the Tobacco and Douglas Elliman segments. Net income climbed to $38.1 million, or $0.25 per diluted share. The company's liquidity remains strong, with cash and cash equivalents of $451 million. Despite the impact of COVID-19 on Douglas Elliman's revenue for the first nine months of 2020, the segment implemented cost-cutting measures that resulted in a reduction of $39.8 million in expenses compared to the previous year. The Tobacco segment reported revenue increases and margin growth, leading to a 25% surge in adjusted operating income. Liggett's third-quarter results reflect higher gross profit margins and lower per-unit Master Settlement Agreement expenses. Notably, Eagle 20's volume grew by approximately 2% compared to 2019 despite increased net pricing, demonstrating the effectiveness of the company's income growth strategy. Vector Group is confident in its operating outlook, citing its strong cash reserves, consistent growth in tobacco volume and profits, and initiatives to position the real estate business for long-term success. The company remains committed to its quarterly cash dividend policy.
