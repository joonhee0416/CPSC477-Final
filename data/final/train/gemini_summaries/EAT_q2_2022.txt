Brinker International reported strong second-quarter earnings with adjusted earnings per share of $0.71, beating expectations. Comparable restaurant sales surged by 17.7%, driven by improved staffing, increased dining room demand, and take-out and delivery remaining strong. Despite inflationary pressures, the company has implemented appropriate pricing actions, with menu prices now up over 4%. Chili's has consistently outperformed the industry for 16 consecutive quarters due to its commitment to hiring and training quality staff. Brinker is also investing in technology, including a handheld system that has improved server earnings and guest metrics. The company is expanding its development plans, including small footprint off-premise designs and virtual brands. Despite the Omicron variant impacting January sales, Brinker remains confident in its ability to drive growth through strategic initiatives and technological advantages.
