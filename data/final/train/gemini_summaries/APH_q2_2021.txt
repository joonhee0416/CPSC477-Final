Amphenol reported strong financial results for the second quarter of 2021, exceeding expectations and achieving record sales of $2.654 billion, up 34% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Earnings per share also rose significantly, with adjusted diluted earnings per share reaching $0.61, a 53% increase compared to the previous year. The company's strong performance was driven by broad-based growth across major end markets, including automotive, military, industrial, and broadband. Despite challenges related to the pandemic and supply chain disruptions, Amphenol maintained high adjusted operating margins of 20%, primarily due to effective cost management and operational leverage. The company also continues to execute a strategic acquisition program, most recently adding Unlimited Services to bolster its position in the industrial market. Looking ahead to the third quarter, Amphenol anticipates continued sales growth in the range of 14% to 16%, with adjusted diluted earnings per share projected between $0.60 and $0.62, despite expected moderation in certain end markets. The company remains optimistic about long-term growth opportunities and is committed to delivering sustainable value to shareholders.
