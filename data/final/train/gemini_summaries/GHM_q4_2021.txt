Graham Corporation recently acquired Barber-Nichols, a $70 million transformative acquisition that significantly enhances the company's financial outlook. The acquisition diversifies revenue streams by expanding into the defense industry, which provides greater stability and long-term asset base growth. Barber-Nichols operates in complementary markets, including defense, aerospace, and commercial space, and brings strong management capabilities and a talented workforce. The acquisition immediately boosts top-line revenue by approximately 50%, with an expectation of $45 to $48 million from Barber-Nichols for the 10 months they will be owned in fiscal 2022. Furthermore, the combination of Barber-Nichols' backlog and Graham's existing backlog creates a total of nearly $240 million. Graham also anticipates modest growth in organic defense revenue, with a target of over $40 million by fiscal 2025. The acquisition allows Graham to utilize a more efficient balance sheet, with reduced dormant cash and access to new credit facilities for future growth opportunities. The company emphasized that no synergies were assumed in the transaction, but the combined entity expects to benefit from sharing best practices and leveraging each other's capabilities.
