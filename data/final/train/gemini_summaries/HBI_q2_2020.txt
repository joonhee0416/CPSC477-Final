Hanesbrands reported a strong second quarter despite the impact of COVID-19, with revenue increasing 6% to $1.74 billion. Excluding PPE revenue, apparel sales declined approximately 40%, outperforming the company's expectations. The company's new PPE business, which generated over $750 million in revenue, led to a 58% increase in adjusted EPS to $0.60. Other highlights include strong cash flow generation of $65 million, boosting year-to-date operating cash flow by $40 million compared to last year. The company ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of liquidity, providing ample financial flexibility. Although Hanesbrands faces ongoing uncertainty due to COVID-19, the company is encouraged by positive underlying momentum in its core apparel business. It anticipates sequential improvement in apparel sales declines in Q3 and Q4, expects to generate over $150 million in PPE revenue in H2 2020, and remains confident in generating positive cash flow in the second half of the year.
