SCI reported a remarkable increase in earnings per share for Q1 2021, driven by significant funeral volume and cemetery property sales. Funeral revenue surged 22%, with an increase in core funeral services and SCI Direct production. Cemetery revenue soared 54%, with both at-need and preneed sales contributing substantially. Preneed cemetery sales production surpassed expectations, growing an impressive 67% due to increased velocity and a higher core average sale. As a result, SCI has revised its 2021 guidance to a range of $2.70-$3.00 per share, expecting earnings per share growth in the low or mid-teen percentage range for 2022 and 2023. Despite temporary pull forward effects, the company anticipates strong long-term growth as baby boomers age and its technological investments drive market share and enhance customer experiences. With a robust balance sheet and positive cash flow, SCI is well-positioned for future growth and shareholder value creation.
