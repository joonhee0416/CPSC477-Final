Carter's reported a strong third quarter, with sales increasing from the previous year and exceeding pre-pandemic levels in 2019. This growth was primarily driven by strong demand for the company's brands across all distribution channels. Despite supply chain disruptions and inflation, Carter's improved price realization and margins, leading to record gross margin and gross profit dollars. The company also benefited from cost savings and leaner inventories, which contributed to higher earnings and profitability. Looking ahead, Carter's expects to continue its growth trajectory, forecasting full-year sales of approximately $3.450 billion, up from its previous forecast. Adjusted operating income is projected to be $490 million, and adjusted earnings per share are expected to reach $7.57, an increase from the company's initial guidance. Carter's is optimistic about the post-pandemic recovery, citing positive indicators such as increased savings among Americans, rising wages, and a projected increase in births. The company also believes that the proposed legislation focused on helping lower and middle-income families could have a positive impact on its business. Carter's is facing challenges due to supply chain disruption and inflation but has taken steps to mitigate these risks by reducing exposure to China, investing in air freight, and negotiating favorable freight rates. The company remains focused on serving the needs of its customers and forecasts a strong fourth quarter to conclude a successful year.
