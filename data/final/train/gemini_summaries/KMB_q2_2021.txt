Kimberly-Clark's Q2 earnings results fell short of expectations due to higher input cost inflation and a sharper-than-anticipated decline in Consumer Tissue demand. The company faced unprecedented volatility in raw material prices and supply chain disruptions, compounded by reduced at-home consumption and destocking in the Tissue segment. Despite these headwinds, the company remains confident and committed to its brand-building strategy.

Personal Care saw organic sales growth of 6% globally, led by strong volume gains. Notably, the brand captured the number one diaper share in China and Brazil. While North American Consumer Tissue experienced a decline, KC Professional showed signs of recovery with year-over-year and sequential growth. The company took decisive pricing actions to offset inflation and is implementing cost-cutting measures to mitigate its impact.

Looking ahead, Kimberly-Clark expects improved results in the second half, driven by pricing actions and stabilization in demand. The company remains focused on executing its KC Strategy 2022, investing in innovation, commercial capabilities, and technology. Despite near-term challenges, the company emphasizes its commitment to sustainable long-term growth and prioritizes the health and safety of stakeholders during the ongoing pandemic.
