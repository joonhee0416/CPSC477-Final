Despite the ongoing challenges posed by COVID-19, Teleflex reported positive Q4 results with revenue growth driven by Vascular Access, Interventional Urology, and other product categories. The impact of COVID-19 had a negative impact of approximately $61 million on Q4 revenue, but underlying growth was estimated at 11% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted gross and operating margins improved sequentially compared to Q2 and Q3, resulting in adjusted earnings per share exceeding expectations. Notably, the acquisition of Z-Medica is expected to contribute $60-$70 million in revenue in 2021 and 2.5 points of growth, further enhancing Teleflex's financial performance. The company remains confident in its long-term growth prospects, aiming to achieve constant currency revenue growth of 6-7% annually and adjusted gross and operating margins of 60-61% and 30-31%, respectively, once a more normalized environment is regained.
