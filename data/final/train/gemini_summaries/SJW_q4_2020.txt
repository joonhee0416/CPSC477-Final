In Q4 2020, SJW Group's merger with Connecticut Water Service (CTWS) continued to drive its financial results. Revenue climbed by $9.9 million to $135.7 million, primarily due to customer usage and rate increases. Net income surged to $13.3 million ($0.46 per share), a significant improvement from a net loss of $5.5 million ($0.19 per share) in Q4 2019. This increase was driven by lower CTWS merger expenses, increased customer usage, and lower administrative costs, partially offset by higher water production costs. For the full year 2020, revenue reached $564.5 million, a 34% increase, and net income reached $61.5 million ($2.14 per share) compared to $23.4 million ($0.82 per share) in 2019. The company attributed these gains primarily to customer usage and rate increases. SJW Group remains committed to investing in infrastructure, with plans for $239 million in improvements in 2021 and over $1 billion in the next five years. It has filed general rate cases in California and Connecticut, seeking to recover costs and support future growth. Despite concerns about water supplies in California and challenges in Texas due to severe weather, the company expressed optimism about its future success, emphasizing its geographic and regulatory diversity and continued focus on growth.
