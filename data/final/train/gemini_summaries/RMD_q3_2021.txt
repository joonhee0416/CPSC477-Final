ResMed reported mixed Q3 results. Revenue was consistent year-over-year, dropping 3% in constant currency terms due to the absence of COVID-19 related ventilator sales in the prior year. Excluding this impact, revenue grew 1% in constant currency. Operating profit rose 2% due to cost management. GAAP net income was negatively impacted by a $255 million tax reserve related to transfer pricing discussions with the Australian Tax Office. Excluding this reserve, non-GAAP net income grew 1%. Key growth areas included increased demand for digital health solutions and strong sales of masks and other accessories. The company expects low single-digit sequential revenue growth in Q4 FY21 and a return to normalized growth trends in FY22. ResMed continues to invest in R&D and innovation, with a focus on developing its next-generation sleep apnea platform, AirSense 11. The company also acquired Citus Health, a digital health leader in patient engagement solutions. ResMed anticipates continued growth in its Software-as-a-Service business and plans to allocate capital to debt reduction, R&D, tuck-in acquisitions, and share buybacks.
