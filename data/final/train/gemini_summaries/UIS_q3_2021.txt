Unisys reported mixed performance in the third quarter, with revenue declining 1.5% year-over-year to $488 million, mainly due to a drop in DWS revenue. However, gross profit and free cash flow improved. Cloud and Infrastructure Solutions (C&I) revenue grew 1.7%, driven by a 26% increase in Cloud revenue. Enterprise Computing Solutions (ECS) showed modest improvement, with revenue growing 1.8%. Digital Workplace Solutions (DWS) saw a 4.7% revenue decline due to the exit of non-core contracts and supply chain challenges. Total company TCV and ACV increased by 13% and 30%, respectively. Non-GAAP operating profit margin was 5.7%, below the 8.6% in the same period last year. The company continues its cost optimization program, with annualized savings in the high end of the $130 million to $160 million range. The capital-light strategy and focus on best-in-class offerings remain a key part of Unisys' plans, with capital expenditures reduced by 18.4%. The company's financial goals remain unchanged, and it reaffirms its full-year 2021 guidance. Unisys also announced leadership changes, with CFO Mike Thomson appointed as President and COO, effective upon the hiring of a new CFO.
