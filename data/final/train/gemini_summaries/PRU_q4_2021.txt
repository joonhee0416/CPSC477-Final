Prudential reported robust financial results for 2021, driven by strong investment performance and demand for products tailored to evolving customer needs during the pandemic. The company is repositioning its business mix to generate sustainable long-term growth with reduced market sensitivity, while continuing to advance its cost savings program, targeting $750 million by the end of 2023. Prudential's disciplined capital deployment strategy includes enhancing shareholder returns, reducing financial leverage, and investing in business growth. In 2021, the company returned $4.3 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, and increased its quarterly dividend by 4%. Prudential is committed to environmental, social, and governance initiatives, aiming for net-zero emissions by 2050 and restricting new investments in companies heavily reliant on thermal coal. The company's PGIM asset management division had record fees due to strong performance, with over 95% of assets outperforming benchmarks over the last three, five, and 10 years. Prudential's strong capital position supports its AA financial strength rating and various funding sources.
