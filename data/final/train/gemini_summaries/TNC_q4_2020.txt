In 2020, Tennant faced pandemic-related challenges but remained focused on its enterprise strategy, which emphasizes competitive advantage, process simplification, and innovation. The company reduced operating costs through divestments, product line simplification, and supply chain optimization. It also invested in robotic floor cleaning solutions, offering a comprehensive range of autonomous cleaning technologies.

Financially, Tennant reported a decrease in net sales for the fourth quarter of 2020 due to the pandemic, with organic sales declining 8.9%. However, adjusted gross margin improved due to pricing actions and cost-cutting initiatives. For the full year 2020, net sales declined 11.8% organically, but adjusted EBITDA remained strong at 11.9% of sales.

Looking ahead, Tennant expects a market recovery in 2021, supported by its strategic investments and operating model improvements. The company projects net sales growth of 5-8% and adjusted earnings per share of $3.50 to $3.95. It is cautiously optimistic about the pace of recovery and is prepared to address any ongoing pandemic-related issues. Dave Huml will assume the CEO role on March 1, marking a seamless transition in leadership.
