In Q3 2019, Everest achieved a strong performance, producing operating earnings of $3.39 per share, despite facing $280 million in catastrophe losses. The company's attritional underwriting gain of $250 million nearly offset the cat loss. Notably, Everest's operating income for the year-to-date period reached $742 million, reflecting solid investment income and underwriting profits of $365 million (excluding cats). The company's strategic focus on reducing cat volatility through diversification and exposure reduction has contributed to these resilient results. Everest has seen growth in mortgage risk and casualty lines in the reinsurance sector, as well as a successful push into the specialty insurance space. Market conditions are favorable, with rates improving and conservative loss picks managing frequency and severity trends. The company remains committed to underwriting profitability and sustainable growth, maintaining a strong balance sheet and enduring customer relationships. Everest's diversified franchise, experienced leadership team, and robust financial position are seen as key strengths that will enable it to succeed regardless of market conditions.
