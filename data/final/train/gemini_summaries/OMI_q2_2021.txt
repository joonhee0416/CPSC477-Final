Owens & Minor reported a strong Q2 with revenue growth of 38% driven by strong elective procedures and PPE demand. The company has reaffirmed its guidance for 2021 and 2022, with adjusted earnings per share expected to be between $3.75 and $4.25 for 2021. The company's strategic investments remain on track, with new manufacturing capacity for nitrile gloves expected to begin contributing to financial results in early 2022. Despite inflationary pressures and transportation costs, the company is seeing strong demand for its products and services. While Q3 revenue is expected to decline slightly due to easing glove cost pass-through, Q4 is expected to improve due to the seasonal impact of healthcare utilization. The company's strong financial performance and recent credit upgrade have provided it with financial flexibility to implement its growth strategy.
