MGIC reported another strong quarter with net income of $153.1 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.44. This growth was driven by a record $33.6 billion in new insurance written, despite a decrease in refinance activity. Purchase transactions now account for over 85% of new applications received. While NIW growth is expected to slow in the second half of the year, strong purchase market conditions are anticipated to continue. The company's insurance in force grew almost 14% year-over-year to $262 billion, with a low 11.6% loss ratio. Credit performance remained positive, with a low number of new delinquency notices received. MGIC's capital position remains strong, with a $2.3 billion excess over PMIERs minimum required assets and a 167% PMIERs efficiency ratio. The company declared a $150 million dividend from MGIC to its holding company and authorized a 33% increase in the quarterly common stock dividend, reflecting its confidence in the market and its commitment to shareholder value creation.
