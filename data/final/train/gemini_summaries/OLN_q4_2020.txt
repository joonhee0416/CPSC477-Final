Olin Corporation's fourth quarter results showcased the team's commitment to prioritizing value throughout the entire earning conversion unit (ECU), effectively lifting margins across chlorine, EDC, and derivatives while maintaining caustic pricing. Winchester delivered its best quarterly performance in history, driven by strong demand for shooting sports and military modernization initiatives. Looking ahead to Q1 2021, Olin anticipates Epoxy to lead earnings with a record-breaking performance, merchant chlorine net-backs reaching multi-year highs, and continued productivity gains. The company's focus on debt reduction and disciplined capital spending will result in an improved net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 3x within the next 12 months. Beyond 2021, Olin aims to achieve $1.5 billion in EBITDA, supported by structural moves to expand its strategy and increase molecular throughput.
