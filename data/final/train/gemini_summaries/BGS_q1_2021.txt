Spices and seasonings led brand performance, with net sales up 41.2% to $97.7 million. The company's adjusted diluted earnings per share rose to $0.52, an increase of 13% compared to Q1 2020. Despite inflationary pressures, B&G Foods expects to generate adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales of approximately 18% to 18.5% for the year. Management reaffirmed the 2021 sales guidance of $2.05 billion to $2.1 billion, inclusive of a full year of Crisco acquisition benefits. They anticipate Q2 to present challenges, as sales in Q2 2020 were significantly boosted by pantry loading at the onset of the pandemic. Nevertheless, they expect base business net sales in Q2 to trend closer to 2019 levels and remain optimistic about continued solid results.
