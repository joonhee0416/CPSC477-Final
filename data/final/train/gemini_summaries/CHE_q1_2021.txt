VITAS Healthcare reported a decline in revenue and adjusted EBITDA for Q1 2021 due to the ongoing impact of the pandemic on hospice admissions and senior housing referrals. However, Roto-Rooter performed exceptionally well with record-breaking demand for residential services, driving an 18.9% revenue increase. Despite challenges, VITAS' adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 66 basis points year-over-year. The company continues to monitor the recovery of senior housing occupancy and expects to provide updated 2021 earnings guidance in July. Notably, the nursing home and assisted living facility admissions faced significant declines of 26.2% and 13.1%, respectively, compared to the previous year. The median length of stay decreased to 12 days, two days shorter than the first quarter of 2020.
