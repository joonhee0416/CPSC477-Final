Murphy Oil's strong first quarter performance was marked by a 7% beat on oil production guidance, with Eagle Ford Shale assets outperforming despite weather challenges. The company achieved $233 million in debt reduction, representing 8% of its total debt, and plans to repurchase an additional $200 million in notes later this year, targeting a total debt decrease of 15% for 2021. Murphy's major Gulf of Mexico projects are progressing on schedule, with Khaleesi/Mormont and Samurai set for first oil in the first half of 2022. Exploration efforts in the Gulf and Brazil are also underway, with the Silverback well currently drilling and the Cutthroat well planned for drilling later this year. The company remains focused on delevering, executing, and exploring, with plans to reduce debt to $1.4 billion by 2024 and potentially explore further reductions after that.
