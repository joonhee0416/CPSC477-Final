In Q4 2021, Capital One's net income reached $2.4 billion ($5.41 per diluted share), driven by loan growth and strong domestic card performance. Revenue increased by 4% to $8.1 billion, while net interest margin improved by 25 basis points to 6.6%. Credit quality remained robust, with charge-off rates and delinquency rates at historically low levels. Total company allowance coverage declined, with a modest release in the fourth quarter. The company repurchased $2.6 billion in common stock, completing a $7.5 billion authorization, and approved an additional $5 billion repurchase authorization. Despite increasing technology investments and rising tech talent costs, Capital One remains optimistic about growth opportunities and believes its modern technology stack will enhance its long-term competitiveness in the accelerating digital revolution in banking.
