Live music has returned with a vengeance. The 2021 summer concert season saw 17 million fans attending Live Nation shows. Festivals sold out in record time, with major festival ticket sales up 10% over 2019. Average amphitheater and major festival pricing increased double-digits, and fans spent at record levels, with onsite spending per fan up over 20%. Despite a tight labor market and new health and safety protocols, Live Nation was able to meet staffing requirements and mitigate major COVID-19 disruptions. Ticketmaster delivered its highest-ever AOI quarter, with its fourth highest fee-bearing GTV quarter excluding refunds. Sponsorship and advertising also rebounded, delivering over $100 million in AOI for the quarter. Looking ahead to 2022, Live Nation is seeing strong leading indicators across all businesses, with confirmed show count, ticket sales, and sponsorship pipeline up double-digits compared to 2019-2020 levels. Ticketmaster is also seeing record-level transacted fee-bearing GTV in Q4, despite already selling 65 million fee-bearing tickets for next year. Live Nation remains confident in its cost-focused delivery of $200 million in structural savings, making it better positioned to invest for future growth. Despite the pandemic's impact, Live Nation believes in the power and potential of live entertainment and expects continued growth in the future.
