Robert Half International experienced a 24% increase in net income per share to $0.98 in Q1 2021 compared to $0.79 in Q1 2020. The company's revenue was $1.398 billion, a decrease of 7% on a reported basis and 8% on an adjusted basis.

The company expressed optimism for the future, citing accelerating staffing results and strong Protiviti growth. Robert Half International's second-quarter guidance projects revenues between $1.435 billion and $1.515 billion, potentially resulting in all-time high earnings per share of $1.05.
