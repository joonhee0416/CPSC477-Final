Choice Hotels continued its strong performance in Q3, outperforming the industry and gaining RevPAR index share against local competitors. RevPAR increased 11.4% compared to Q3 2019, exceeding guidance and continuing the trend of surpassing 2019 levels for five consecutive months. The company's strategic investments in the extended-stay segment drove impressive RevPAR growth of over 18%, outperforming the industry by 20 percentage points. Demand trends remained strong, with weekday occupancy index gains and an increase in long-stay revenue. Choice Privileges loyalty members continued to contribute significantly to revenue, with new members also driving growth. Adjusted EBITDA rose 18% to $133.2 million, driven by improving RevPAR performance, revenue-intense unit growth, and continued cost discipline. The company expects full-year domestic RevPAR to surpass 2019 levels and adjusted EBITDA to exceed 2019 levels, ranging between $382 million and $387 million, despite planned incremental investments in the fourth quarter.
