PCA reported a second quarter net income of $57 million, or $0.59 per share, driven by strong demand for corrugated products. Excluding special items, net income was $132 million, or $1.38 per share, a decrease of $0.66 compared to the same period last year due primarily to lower prices and volume in the paper segment, as well as higher depreciation expense. The Packaging segment performed well, posting an EBITDA margin of 22%, driven by increased volume and cost control. Total company EBITDA, excluding special items, was $299 million. PCA also recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $55.2 million related to goodwill in the paper segment. Despite ongoing challenges related to COVID-19, the company ended the quarter with $853 million of cash on hand and liquidity of over $1.3 billion. Looking forward, PCA expects the third quarter to be stronger for corrugated products demand and is evaluating the impact of shelter-in-place and lockdown conditions on its paper operations.
