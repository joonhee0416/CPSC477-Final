Despite a sales decline of 19.4% and a 20.6% decrease in same-restaurant sales, Darden Restaurants reported strong profitability in the third quarter. While dining room closures and restrictions negatively impacted operations, the company's focus on safety, restaurant execution, technology, and business model transformation mitigated the impact. Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse exhibited resilience, with both segments increasing profit margins despite sales declines. The company's focus on operational simplification, reduced marketing expenses, and increased off-premise sales contributed to improved margins. Looking forward to the third quarter, Darden anticipates total sales between 65% and 70% of prior year levels, with EBITDA ranging from $170 million to $210 million. Despite current challenges, the company remains committed to its long-term goal of achieving 100% of pre-COVID EBITDA dollars at approximately 90% of pre-COVID sales. Darden also announced leadership changes, with Rick Cardenas becoming President and Raj Vennam taking over as Chief Financial Officer.
