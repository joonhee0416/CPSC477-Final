Darden Restaurants reported a $1.7 billion quarterly revenue, a 19.4% decrease attributed to negative same-restaurant sales of 20.6%. Despite this decline, diluted net earnings per share remained strong at $0.74. The company has focused on prioritizing four key areas: employee and guest safety, restaurant execution, technology deployment for an enhanced guest experience, and long-term business model transformation. Olive Garden experienced a 19.9% dip in same-restaurant sales but maintained 80% of sales compared to last year. LongHorn Steakhouse also performed well, with almost 20% of restaurants reporting sales growth. The company's digital efforts have been crucial, with over 55% of off-premise sales being fully digital transactions and Olive Garden achieving a 20% digital sales share. Darden remains optimistic, with CEO Gene Lee expressing confidence in the company's long-term prospects despite short-term headwinds. The company is providing a broad range of expectations for the third quarter, with total sales projected to be between 65% and 70% of prior year levels.
