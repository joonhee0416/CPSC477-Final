Sunoco recorded a strong third quarter, with net income of $104 million, driven by a 6.4% year-over-year increase in fuel volumes and sustained fuel margins. Adjusted EBITDA reached $198 million, surpassing the previous year's quarter. Despite higher operating expenses and economic disruptions, the partnership generated $146 million in distributable cash flow, maintaining its coverage ratio above the target of 1.40 times. The NuStar and Cato acquisitions closed recently, bringing modest impacts to 2021 EBITDA. To bolster its financial position, Sunoco issued 4.5% senior notes and redeemed existing higher-rate notes, reducing financing costs. The company expects a solid fourth quarter with continued healthy fuel margins and steady volume. Looking ahead, Sunoco anticipates another positive year in 2022 and remains committed to disciplined growth and financial management, prioritizing distribution security and balance sheet strength while pursuing organic and acquisition opportunities.
