EastGroup's third quarter demonstrated resilience with a 6.3% increase in FFO per share compared to Q3 2019, marking 30 consecutive quarters of growth. Notably, occupancy averaged a high 96.6%, driven by strong e-commerce demand. Re-leasing spreads reached record levels at 28% GAAP. Same-store NOI increased 3% for the quarter, contributing to year-to-date growth of 3.6%. FFO guidance has been revised upward to $5.35 per share, representing a $0.07 increase from the previous forecast and exceeding pre-pandemic expectations. The company's financial strength remains robust with a debt-to-total market capitalization ratio of 19%, debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.9 times, and interest and fixed charge coverage ratios over 7.4 times. Rent collections have been resilient, with 99.5% of third-quarter revenue collected or deferred. Despite initial concerns, tenant financial stress and loss of occupancy have not materialized as expected. EastGroup's strategic focus includes maintaining occupancy and liquidity, restarting development in select submarkets, and acquiring new land sites. The company remains optimistic about the future, citing positive market trends and the continued demand for last-mile distribution space in its Sun Belt markets.
