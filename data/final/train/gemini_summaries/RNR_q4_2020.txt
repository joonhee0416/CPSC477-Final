In 2020, RenaissanceRe faced challenges from COVID-19 and weather-related catastrophes, but still grew book value per share by 15% and tangible book value per share by 18%. The company deployed $1.1 billion of capital raised in June 2020, resulting in an expected $1 billion increase in net premiums written for 2021 while maintaining consistent tail risk exposure. The January 1 renewal was successful, with growth in casualty and specialty lines, improved expected underwriting margins, and favorable pricing in retrocession and property catastrophe reinsurance markets. RenaissanceRe also strengthened its joint venture partnerships, raised $700 million in capital, and increased its ownership in DaVinci and Medici. The company expects to continue finding profitable growth opportunities in 2021 and believes it is well-positioned to navigate ongoing challenges, including the long-term impact of climate change on extreme weather events.
