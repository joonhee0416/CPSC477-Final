In the midst of external challenges including mild winter weather, currency fluctuations, and COVID-19 impacts, Compass Minerals delivered strong year-to-date consolidated operating earnings and EBITDA growth of 19% and 10%, respectively, with free cash flow increasing 93% to over $188 million. Despite lower third-quarter sales volumes in all segments, Salt segment improvements, particularly in logistics and production costs, helped offset these declines. Plant Nutrition experienced timing issues, with some sales expected to shift to the fourth quarter due to extreme wildfires and drought, particularly in North America. In South America, dry weather conditions and early agricultural product sales in the second quarter contributed to third-quarter sluggishness. Despite these challenges, the company maintains its Plant Nutrition sales volume ranges for the year and expects fourth-quarter demand increases in both Plant Nutrition segments. By focusing on cost containment and optimization initiatives, Compass Minerals still anticipates EBITDA growth for the full year and in 2021, citing underlying market resilience and the dedication of its employees.
