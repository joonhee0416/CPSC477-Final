Viad and its subsidiaries, Pursuit and GES, reported preliminary first-quarter results amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. While revenue increased by 7.1% year-over-year to $306 million, the company faced operational impacts from March onwards due to event postponements and cancellations. To mitigate the crisis, Viad took swift actions to enhance its financial position, including drawing on its revolving line of credit, obtaining covenant waivers, implementing cost-cutting measures, suspending non-essential expenditures, and reducing salaries for top executives. Despite the challenging outlook for the second quarter, Viad remains optimistic about Pursuit's potential for a faster recovery due to the gradual resumption of travel and domestic bookings. GES, on the other hand, is expected to experience a slower rebound, but the company is focusing on restructuring to emerge leaner and more client-focused. Viad believes that experiential travel and live events will rebound in the long term, with face-to-face interactions remaining vital for networking and education. In response to the pandemic, the company plans to reimagine its operations to better meet the evolving needs of clients and enhance its competitive position post-COVID-19.
