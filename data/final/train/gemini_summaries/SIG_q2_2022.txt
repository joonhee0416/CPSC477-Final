Signet Jewelers reported strong second-quarter results, with total sales reaching $1.8 billion, a 38.1% increase from two years prior. Non-GAAP operating margin improved to 12.5%. The company attributed its success to its Inspiring Brilliance strategy, which includes differentiating its banners, expanding its product offerings to meet changing consumer trends, and enhancing its Connected Commerce capabilities. Signet observed increased demand for higher-priced jewelry, self-purchasing, and engagement rings, driven by positive consumer confidence and a rise in the number of planned engagements. The company's Connected Commerce initiatives, such as online ordering with in-store pickup and virtual consulting, are gaining traction, particularly in the bridal category. Signet remains cautious about potential headwinds, including inflationary pressures and concerns over COVID-19 variants. Despite these concerns, the company raised its fiscal 2022 guidance, reflecting strong Q2 performance and expectations of continued momentum in Q3. Signet plans to open up to 100 new locations and close over 100 stores, primarily through the expansion of its Piercing Pagoda concept. The company also announced an expanded share repurchase authorization of $225 million.
