CMS Energy reported strong Q3 results, continuing to exceed expectations and affirming its commitment to financial targets. The sale of EnerBank for over $1 billion provides funding for clean energy initiatives, eliminating the company's equity needs through 2024. CMS's Voluntary Green Pricing program received approval, adding 1,000 megawatts of renewable generation to its portfolio. Despite rising gas prices, the company's storage field and pass-through clause protect customers from market volatility. CMS reaffirmed its full-year adjusted EPS guidance of $2.85 to $2.87 and raised its 2021 guidance to $2.63 to $2.65, citing strong execution and financial flexibility. Year-to-date EPS of $2.18 surpassed the full-year target of $2.12, with key drivers being rate relief, favorable weather, commercial and industrial sales recovery, and cost reductions. CMS remains committed to dividend growth of 6% to 8% and a payout ratio of 60%.
