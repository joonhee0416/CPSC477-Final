Tapestry reported strong q1 results with sales increasing 26% to $1.48 billion, well above pre-pandemic levels. All three brands—Coach, Kate Spade, and Stuart Weitzman—performed well, contributing to an 8.5-point improvement in operating margin. Notably, Coach remains a standout with a revenue increase of 27%, driven by strong customer engagement and increased average unit retail (AUR). Kate Spade made progress towards its strategic goals, achieving mid-single-digit direct sales growth over pre-pandemic levels, while Stuart Weitzman remains on track to restore profitability this year. The company's financial outlook for fiscal 2022 also received an upgrade, with expected revenue reaching approximately $6.6 billion and earnings per share estimated between $3.45 and $3.50. Tapestry is taking bold steps to mitigate supply chain constraints and capture holiday demand, reinforcing its confidence in the strength of its brands and its commitment to shareholder returns.
