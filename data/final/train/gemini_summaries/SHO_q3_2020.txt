Despite facing unprecedented challenges, the company's 16 operating hotels experienced encouraging occupancy growth, leading to a reduction in cash burn rate to approximately $16-$20 million per month. Notably, the recently reopened larger hotels, such as the Renaissance Orlando and Hyatt Regency San Francisco, are expected to further improve portfolio performance. The company's strong liquidity position, with $504 million in cash and an undrawn $500 million credit facility, provides a significant cushion and allows for opportunistic investment. While group business remains weak, transient demand has shown signs of recovery, with weekly net reservations declining by 67% in October compared to the previous year. The company has proactively rebooked 23% of cancelled group room nights and booked over 106,000 new group rooms for future months, representing approximately $90-$95 million in potential revenue. Despite posting a third-quarter adjusted EBITDA loss of $36 million and adjusted FFO loss per share of $0.26, the company remains optimistic about the recovery and expects to return to profitability in the future.
