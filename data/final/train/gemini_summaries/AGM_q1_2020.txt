Farmer Mac had a strong start to the year, providing $1.3 billion in new credit to rural America in the first quarter of 2020. Despite challenges presented by COVID-19 beginning in March, their strong underlying fundamentals and resilient business model have enabled them to continue operations and fulfill their mission. They have maintained strong access to capital markets and have remained well capitalized, with a strong liquidity position that has been at or above $1 billion for most of the last two months. While they experienced a normal seasonal uptick in delinquencies in the first quarter, their credit quality has remained healthy. They have approved 71 payment deferment requests related to COVID-19 through May 1 with a total principal balance of $78.9 million, which is less than 0.5% of outstanding credit. They expect to see an increase in these deferment requests over the next quarter. The growth in loan purchase net volume in Farm & Ranch, USDA, and Rural Utilities was partially offset by a sequential decrease in long-term standby purchase commitments and guaranteed securities. They also saw a growth in institutional credits, largely driven by their ability to provide short-term liquidity for two of their largest counterparties during the volatile capital markets environment in March.
