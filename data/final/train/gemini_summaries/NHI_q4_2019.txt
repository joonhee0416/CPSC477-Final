Despite facing headwinds in 2019, NHI reported strong financial results, with NAREIT FFO, normalized FFO, and adjusted FFO all at or above the guidance range. The company's cash NOI increased 7% to $290.5 million, driven by organic growth, new investments, and lease escalators. NHI's balance sheet remains strong, with a debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 4.7 and ample liquidity. For 2020, NHI expects NFFO to increase 3.5% to $5.67-$5.71 per share and AFFO to increase 4.5% to $5.31-$5.35 per share. The company also announced a 5% increase in quarterly dividends to $1.1025 per common share. Despite the challenging senior housing industry, NHI's skilled nursing portfolio continues to show strong coverage, which is expected to improve with the PDPM reimbursement system. The company is actively pursuing new investments and announced $150 million in acquisitions for 2020, including a $135 million deal for the Class A Timber Ridge CCRC.
