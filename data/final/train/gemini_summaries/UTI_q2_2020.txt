In the second quarter, the company faced COVID-19 challenges, but still managed to post solid results. Despite a revenue impact of $2.5-$3 million, due to student leaves of absence, profitability was only affected by $1.25-$1.7 million. To mitigate the impact, the company implemented cost-cutting measures, including furloughing 280 employees, and maximizing cash optimization opportunities. New student starts grew 6.6% year-over-year, excluding the Norwood campus, driven by higher enrollment and show rate improvements. The company has since seen an increase in active students, currently around 8,300.

To adapt to the pandemic, the company swiftly transitioned to online learning, allowing students to progress their education. The online curriculum has proven successful, with over 11,000 students enrolled and over 8,000 actively using the platform. The company also revised its marketing strategy, focusing on the durable opportunities in technical fields and intensifying its focus on social media, which has led to improved inquiry activity.

With the gradual resumption of hands-on labs and the introduction of a blended learning model, the company is seeking to minimize financial impacts and ensure the safety of students and employees. The company's long-term growth strategy remains intact, and it anticipates benefits from the new marketing and admissions approaches, as well as the blended learning format.
