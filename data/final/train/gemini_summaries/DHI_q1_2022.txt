D.R. Horton reported a strong first quarter with earnings per diluted share increasing 48% to $3.17. Consolidated revenues increased 19% to $7.1 billion, driven by a 27.4% gross profit margin on home sales. Despite a 3% decrease in active selling communities, net sales orders increased 5% in volume and 29% in value. The company has a robust inventory position, with 54,800 homes and a backlog of 29,300 homes, and expects double-digit volume growth in 2022. While supply chain challenges and rising construction costs persist, Horton plans to navigate these headwinds by continuing to increase prices to offset most cost pressures. The company also continues to focus on controlling SG&A expenses and generating positive cash flow to support its investment in rental operations and shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases. Horton remains committed to its long-term growth and value creation strategy, leveraging its experienced teams, industry-leading market share, and diverse product offerings.
