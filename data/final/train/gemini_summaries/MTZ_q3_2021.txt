MasTec reported a strong Q3 with $2.4 billion in revenue, a 42% increase year-over-year, and $278 million in adjusted EBITDA. The company is well-positioned to benefit from growth opportunities in communication, transmission, and clean energy segments, with a long-term goal of achieving $10 billion annual revenue within a shorter time frame than previously anticipated. While margin execution in non-Oil and Gas segments has fallen short of expectations in 2021 due to various challenges, MasTec remains confident in its ability to achieve targeted margins. Backlog stood at $8.5 billion at quarter-end, an $821 million increase year-over-year. The company also announced a new $2 billion credit facility, improving liquidity and potentially providing a path towards an investment-grade credit rating. MasTec expects annual 2021 revenue of $8 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $930 million, and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5.55, an increase from its previous guidance of $5.45.
