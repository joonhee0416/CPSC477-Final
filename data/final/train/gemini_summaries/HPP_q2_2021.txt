Hudson Pacific Properties reported a strong second quarter with robust financial results and positive momentum. The tech and media industries continue to flourish, driving demand for office and studio space. The company is seeing a return to the office in most companies, with potential vaccine mandates. All major studio tenants have resumed or will soon resume production on Hudson Pacific's lots. The company announced two major expansions of its Sunset Studios platform: Sunset Glenoaks, a large-scale studio facility in Los Angeles, and its first international expansion into the UK with a significant studio development north of London. These projects will offer advanced infrastructure and sustainable operations. Hudson Pacific's rent collections remained strong at 99% overall, and physical office occupancy has improved to a range of 5% to 55%. Office leasing activity has accelerated, with a deal pipeline of 1.4 million square feet. The company has signed 510,000 square feet of deals with positive rent spreads. However, the company expects full physical occupancy and related revenues to not return to pre-COVID levels in 2021. For the full year 2021, Hudson Pacific projects FFO per share of $1.90 to $1.96, excluding specified items. Additionally, the company's strong liquidity position and low leverage provide a solid financial foundation.
