Boston Beer Company reports strong depletions growth of 36% in Q1, driven by demand for Truly Hard Seltzer and Twisted Tea brands. Despite this, net income decreased due to increased expenses related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The company has withdrawn its previous full-year financial guidance due to ongoing uncertainties caused by the pandemic. Despite this, Boston Beer maintains a strong cash position and has taken proactive measures to support its distributors and the restaurant industry during this challenging time. The company has established the Samuel Adams Restaurant Strong Fund, donated $2.1 million to bar and restaurant workers, and shifted production to hand sanitizer to meet community needs. Boston Beer expects wholesaler inventory levels to return to more normal levels in the latter half of the year.
