Martin Marietta Materials posted record profitability in both the second quarter and the first half of the year, driven by favorable pricing and proactive cost management. Consolidated gross margin expanded 200 basis points despite slightly lower revenues. Adjusted EBITDA increased 7.5% to $407 million, and fully diluted earnings per share rose 16% to $3.49. Strong demand for building materials continued in North Texas and the Front Range of Colorado, and aggregate shipments grew in Georgia, Florida, and Indiana. Aggregates pricing improved 3.3%, with all divisions contributing to growth. Cement shipments declined 3%, driven by lower oil and gas activity, but pricing remained resilient in North and Central Texas. Targeted downstream businesses, such as ready mixed concrete and asphalt, performed well, with increased shipments and pricing. Magnesia Specialties faced challenges due to COVID-19 disruptions, resulting in lower product demand and a decline in gross margin.

Despite macroeconomic headwinds, Martin Marietta anticipates favorable pricing trends to continue, with aggregates pricing expected to increase 3-4% for the year. The company remains confident in its financial strength and liquidity. It expects a gradual slowdown in product demand in the coming quarters but believes that infrastructure construction will remain resilient. State DOTs may face funding challenges, but federal infrastructure packages could provide multi-year upside. Nonresidential construction activity is expected to shift towards heavy industrial projects, while residential construction is rebounding quicker than expected. Martin Marietta's strategic plan, SOAR 2025, will guide its future growth and performance, with initiatives focused on capital deployment, price discipline, cost management, and sustainable practices.
