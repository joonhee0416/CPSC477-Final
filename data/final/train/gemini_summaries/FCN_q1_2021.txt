Q1 2021 earnings saw a 13.5% increase in revenue to $686.3 million, with double-digit growth noted. Despite the expected decline in restructuring services, both forensic and litigation consulting (FLC) and economic consulting sectors saw notable rebounds. The adjusted earnings per share increased from $1.53 in Q1 2020 to $1.89 in Q1 2021, excluding noncash interest expenses related to convertible notes. Billable headcount grew by 12.3%, with a 34.9% increase in corporate finance and restructuring, and sequentially increased by 1.5%. While the strong performance in Q1 provides a positive start, the company cautions that such exceptional strength may not persist throughout the year due to factors such as fixed costs, the conclusion of large engagements, and ongoing uncertainties related to COVID-19. Nevertheless, the company remains confident in its ability to meet its guidance and attributes its success to a diverse portfolio of businesses, a strong team, a focus on staff utilization, and a sound balance sheet.
