In its third quarter earnings call, FirstEnergy reported strong financial results, with earnings per share of $0.85 (GAAP) and $0.82 (operating), exceeding guidance. Positive factors included increased transmission investments, favorable weather-adjusted load, and operational efficiency. The company continues to address legacy issues, including ongoing settlement discussions in Ohio and progress on corporate audits.

FirstEnergy emphasized its focus on strengthening compliance and promoting ethical conduct through policy updates, training initiatives, and an integrated risk management platform. The hiring of Camilo Serna as Vice President of Rates and Regulatory Affairs is expected to enhance regulatory strategy as the company pursues clean energy investments and a timely transition to solar generation. Infrastructure development related to electric vehicles and battery storage is also a key focus area.

The distribution business experienced a decline in revenue due to the absence of Ohio decoupling and lost distribution revenue, but this was partially offset by capital investment programs and lower operating expenses. Transmission investments at MAIT and ATSI subsidiaries contributed to positive results, while interest expenses and a prior year formula rate true-up impacted earnings.

The company's strong performance has resulted in an increase in operating earnings guidance for the full year to $2.55 to $2.65 per share, a 9% increase over 2020. FirstEnergy is exploring a minority asset sale to raise equity capital and support its long-term growth plans, including rate base growth, strategic capex, and the transition to a cleaner electric grid.
