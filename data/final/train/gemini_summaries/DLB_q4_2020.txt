Dolby's fourth quarter revenues surpassed expectations though remained below prior year levels due to COVID-19's ongoing impact. Total revenue reached $271 million, mostly driven by increased unit volumes in devices like TVs and set-top boxes, as well as higher true-ups from earlier shipments. While broadcast and PC licensing revenues increased year-over-year, mobile revenue declined due to timing of contracts. Gross margins were strong at 84.3% on a GAAP basis and 85.1% on a non-GAAP basis. Operating income for the quarter was $54.3 million on a non-GAAP basis. For the first half of FY 2021, the company anticipates year-over-year growth in licensing revenue, offset by a decline in products and services revenue. Q1 revenue is estimated to range from $330 million to $360 million, with Q2 revenue forecasted between $270 million and $300 million. However, due to continued uncertainties, no guidance is being provided for the second half of FY 2021. Dolby remains focused on expanding the presence of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos across devices and content platforms, while also investing in new opportunities through its developer platform to address the growing market for user-generated and interactive content.
