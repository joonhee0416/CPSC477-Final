Despite the unprecedented supply chain challenges, including semiconductor shortages and rising costs, the company reported a modest 2% revenue increase to $4.3 billion in the third quarter. The company's global scale and market mix helped mitigate the impact of these challenges, with volume and mix down only 5% compared to a 20% decline in global light vehicle production. Material cost recovery actions contributed to revenues but had no margin impact. The Accelerate+ structural cost program neutralized the effects of light vehicle semiconductor shortages. The company expects to continue structural cost actions and benefit from the eventual recovery of light vehicle production volumes. Core growth drivers, such as motor parts, commercial truck, off-highway, and industrial applications, delivered year-over-year revenue growth. Looking ahead, the company has revised its fiscal 2021 guidance, assuming flat Q4 global light vehicle production volumes due to semiconductor shortages. This has led to a revised value-add revenue guidance of $13.55 billion to $13.65 billion and adjusted EBITDA guidance of $1.25 billion to $1.28 billion. The company remains focused on cost reduction and improving free cash flow conversion, including reducing its capital intensity and working capital returns.
