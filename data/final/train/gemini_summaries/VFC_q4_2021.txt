Fiscal 2021 was a remarkable year for VF, showcasing the company's strength amidst global challenges. Despite supply chain disruptions, restrictions, and store closures, VF delivered $9.2 billion in revenue and $1.31 in adjusted earnings per share, in line with expectations. Digital and China proved to be key drivers, propelling the business forward. VF's D2C digital business grew 55%, accounting for nearly 30% of total revenue. China exceeded expectations, growing 20% and surpassing $1 billion in revenue. The company exited fiscal 2021 with clean inventory positions, a testament to its disciplined approach. For fiscal 2022, VF expects total revenue to approximate $11.8 billion, representing about 28% growth from fiscal 2021. Excluding Supreme, which is expected to contribute $600 million in revenue, the outlook implies high-single-digit growth relative to fiscal 2020. Vans is expected to drive significant growth, followed by The North Face and Dickies. By region, the Americas, Europe (excluding Supreme), and APAC (led by China) are projected to experience strong growth. VF anticipates gross margin above 56% and an operating margin of 12.8%, indicating high single-digit organic growth in SG&A spending relative to fiscal 2020 levels. The company remains committed to long-term growth and value creation, and its strong balance sheet provides financial flexibility for future opportunities.
