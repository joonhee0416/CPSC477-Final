Hess Corporation reported a strong financial performance in the third quarter, driven by favorable commodity prices and operational efficiency. Net income reached $115 million, compared to a loss of $73 million in the second quarter. Companywide net production, excluding Libya, averaged 265,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, meeting targets despite operational challenges. The Bakken segment achieved a production rate of 148,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with a planned third rig addition expected to enhance cash flow and growth. The Gulf of Mexico production was impacted by Hurricane Ida but is projected to recover in the fourth quarter.

Hess's Guyana operation remains a key driver of growth. Production from theLiza Phase 1 complex averaged 124,000 barrels of oil per day, with Phase 2 on track for start-up in early 2022. Three subsequent developments in the Payara, Yellowtail, and Cataback fields are progressing, targeting various production capacities and timeframes. The plan of development for the Yellowtail project was recently submitted for government approval.

The company estimates a cash flow growth rate of 42% between 2020 and 2023, outperforming peers and ranking in the top 5% of the S&P 500. With a strong cash position and the completion of debt reduction, Hess intends to prioritize dividend increases and share repurchases for shareholder returns. The company's commitment to environmental, social, and governance principles was recognized with a AAA rating from MSCI ESG.
