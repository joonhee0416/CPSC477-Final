Boston Beer Company's Q2 earnings surged 116%, driven by a 46% increase in depletions led by Truly Hard Seltzer and Twisted Tea growth. Despite COVID-19 uncertainties, the company raised its full-year earnings forecast to $11.70-$12.70 per share, projecting 27-35% growth in depletions. The success of Truly has exceeded expectations, while Twisted Tea continues to perform well. However, the company faces operational challenges due to safety protocols and third-party brewery usage, which have impacted gross margins. Despite these challenges, the company is optimistic about the future growth of its brands and plans to invest heavily in the second half, focusing on Truly, Twisted Tea, and Dogfish Head.
