Tyler Technologies reported strong first-quarter results, exceeding expectations. Recurring revenues comprised 75% of total revenues, driven by a 25% growth in subscription revenues. Software licenses and services revenues declined due to project delays and extended sales cycles. The non-GAAP operating margin expanded by 270 basis points to 26.8%. Cash flow strengthened, with a 26% increase in cash from operations and a nearly 34% surge in free cash flow. Bookings reached $247 million, reflecting a 22.8% decline year-over-year but remaining solid overall. The company announced the acquisitions of DataSpec, ReadySub, and NIC, a leading digital government solutions and payments provider with $460.5 million in 2020 revenue. The addition of NIC's services and payments capabilities will enhance Tyler's offerings and provide significant growth opportunities. Tyler's annualized non-GAAP total recurring revenue grew by 12.9% to approximately $886 million, and non-GAAP recurring revenue for SaaS arrangements increased by 26.3%. The company expects the NIC acquisition to be accretive to earnings and EBITDA in 2021. Tyler remains committed to strategic acquisitions, cloud-first initiatives, and environmental and social responsibility efforts.
