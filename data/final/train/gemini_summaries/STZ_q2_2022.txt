Constellation Brands reported solid Q2 performance and raised guidance for its beer business, driven by continued strong demand for its core imported beer portfolio, particularly Modelo Especial. Despite supply challenges, the company expects to return to normal inventory levels by Q4. The hard seltzer segment has shifted, and the company has lowered growth expectations for Corona Hard Seltzer, resulting in a sizable obsolescence charge. Going forward, Constellation will focus on competing in this space where it offers unique value to consumers. The wine and spirits business faced challenges due to underperformance of mainstream brands, but the company continues to enhance its premiumization strategy and strengthen its position in emerging growth channels. Constellation remains committed to its capital allocation strategy, returning $5 billion to shareholders by FY23 through dividends and share repurchases. The company increased its EPS guidance for the year to $10.15 - $10.45, reflecting the increase in beer operating income guidance and share repurchases.
