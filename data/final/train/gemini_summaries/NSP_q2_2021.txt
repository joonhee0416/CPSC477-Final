Insperity saw a strong Q2 with $0.91 adjusted EPS and $60 million of adjusted EBITDA. Paid worksite employees increased 7% over Q2 2020, exceeding expectations. Despite a decline in gross profit due to increased healthcare utilization and SUTA costs, the company experienced favorable outcomes in payroll taxes, including $11 million in federal tax refunds. Operating expenses were balanced through investments in marketing and sales. Insperity anticipates double-digit growth in paid worksite employees in Q3, ahead of previous targets. The company is investing in sales and service capacity, with plans to increase Business Performance Advisors and marketing spend. Insperity remains optimistic about the future due to the growing recognition of the value of HR functions and PEO solutions. The company's premium service model positions it well to capitalize on this market opportunity.
