Maximus reported a strong third quarter with revenue of $1.24 billion, driven by higher-than-expected COVID response work. Diluted earnings per share were $1.51, exceeding analyst estimates. The company raised its full-year guidance, anticipating revenue between $4.2 billion and $4.25 billion and diluted earnings per share between $4.65 and $4.75. However, COVID response work is winding down, and the fourth quarter is expected to reflect a step-down in revenue. Excluding COVID work, the company's organic growth is estimated at 2.6% for fiscal 2021. The acquisitions of Attain Federal and VES have contributed to revenue and are performing in line with projections. The company's operating margin for the quarter was 11.2%, excluding amortization of intangible assets, resulting in a 12.2% margin. Cash flow from operations was impacted by additional investment in working capital, leading to a negative $33 million for the quarter. The company expects cash flow from operations to be in the range of $425 million to $455 million for the full year. Maximus remains optimistic about its long-term prospects, citing the maturing of its organic growth strategies and the benefits of the recent acquisitions. The company believes it is well-positioned to respond to evolving government needs and capitalize on favorable market trends.
