Despite ongoing impacts from COVID-19, TransDigm reported a challenging Q1 with EBITDA as defined margins expanding sequentially due to cost-mitigation efforts. Commercial aftermarket revenue declined by 49%, but sequential bookings showed significant improvement. The defense market exhibited resilience, growing by 1%, while total organic growth was negative 24%. The company noted that the commercial OEM market will continue to be affected throughout 2021 due to reduced production rates and order deferrals. TransDigm raised $1.5 billion during Q3 of 2020 and generated $275 million in positive cash flow from operations in Q1 2021. The company acquired Cobham Aero Connectivity, a proprietary and sole-source business, for $965 million, and sold nonproprietary defense businesses for $30 million. Despite uncertainty, TransDigm remains optimistic about the commercial aftermarket's recovery and anticipates future EBITDA margins to improve throughout fiscal 2021.
