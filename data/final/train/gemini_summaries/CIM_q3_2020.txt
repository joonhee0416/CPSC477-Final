Chimera's strong Q3 performance was driven by a robust housing market and low mortgage rates. Core earnings per share reached $0.33, generating a 15% economic return. The book value appreciated by 12% to $11.91 per share. The surge in residential mortgage prices and strong demand for single-family homes boosted the portfolio, with 90% allocated to mortgage credit. Chimera selectively sold CMBS, reallocating capital to mortgage credit, improving long-term portfolio income. The securitization market remained strong, enabling the completion of three securitizations totaling over $1 billion. Despite a challenging economic climate, Chimera's investment portfolio is well-positioned. The low recourse leverage of 1.3 times capital and ample liquidity provide flexibility for future investments. With positive housing market trends and a strong securitization market, Chimera is optimistic about its future performance.
