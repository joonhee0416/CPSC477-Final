National Fuel reported robust earnings in the third quarter, driven by the acquisition and drilling operations of Seneca Resources. The acquisition boosted production by 50%, leading to a substantial increase in EBITDA. Strong natural gas prices further contributed to the earnings surge. The acquisition has exceeded expectations in both production and operating costs. To capitalize on the high winter natural gas prices, National Fuel has decided to move up completion connectivity at Seneca. This will allow for increased utilization of Leidy South capacity and capture valuable winter premiums. Seneca's capital spending is expected to approach the high end of the previous range, while the company's hedging program is on track with targets. Pipeline construction for the FM100 project is progressing well and remains on schedule for a late 2021 in-service date. The project is expected to provide $50 million in additional revenue annually and complement Seneca's increased production volumes, positioning National Fuel for solid growth and free cash flow generation. The company's utility business is also performing well, with a summer construction program replacing older pipelines to reduce methane emissions. Preliminary guidance for fiscal 2022 projects a 12% earnings increase from the expected 2021 earnings. At an NYMEX price of $3.50, free cash flow is estimated to exceed $250 million, positioning National Fuel well to continue improving its investment grade balance sheet. Overall, National Fuel is poised to deliver significant earnings and free cash flow to its shareholders, driven by its integrated upstream and midstream operations, along with the stability of its utility business.
