Iron Mountain reported exceptional financial performance, achieving record revenue of $1.16 billion in the fourth quarter and $4.5 billion for the full year, marking a 8.5% and 8% year-over-year increase, respectively. Organic growth contributed significantly to these gains. In the data center segment, the company exceeded its bookings target, securing 49 megawatts of leases, including a significant 20-megawatt lease in Virginia. Notably, Iron Mountain is expanding its recently acquired ALM division, which caters to the growing market for secure IT asset management, data destruction, and recycling. The company's global customer base of 225,000, including 95% of the Fortune 1000, positions it well to capitalize on opportunities in the $120 billion TAM. Despite FX headwinds, strong revenue management, cost optimization, and the ITRenew acquisition contributed to EBITDA growth of $56 million and $159 million in the quarter and full year, respectively. With continued investments in data centers, digital solutions, and its expanded ALM offerings, Iron Mountain is well-positioned to drive further growth and deliver strong returns in the coming years.
