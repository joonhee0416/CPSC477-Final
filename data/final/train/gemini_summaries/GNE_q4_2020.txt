Despite customer growth, Genie Energy faced challenges in Q4 due to severe weather events in Texas and Japan that resulted in unprecedented wholesale price spikes. The Texas storm alone caused an estimated $12.8 million in losses for the company. To address these losses, Genie is pausing its dividend and re-evaluating underperforming assets. However, the company remains optimistic about its growth prospects, particularly in the renewable energy sector. Despite the Q4 loss, Genie had a strong 2020 with record revenue and income from operations driven by increased residential electricity consumption. The company ended the year with a strong balance sheet, no debt, and robust working capital.
