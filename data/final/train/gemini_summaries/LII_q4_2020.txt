In the fourth quarter, Lennox International experienced a 3% revenue increase to $914 million, a new high for the quarter. GAAP operating income was $139 million, while GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations was $2.91. These results surpassed estimates due to strong momentum in the Residential business and improvement in Commercial and Refrigeration.

The Residential segment set new fourth quarter records for revenue, profit, and margin, driven by double-digit growth in replacement and new construction business and a 30% increase in indoor air quality revenue. The Commercial segment faced a 13% revenue decline, but profitability remained strong with a 40 basis point margin expansion. Refrigeration saw revenue rise 7%, as reported, and 3% at constant currency. The Refrigeration segment is expected to improve margin throughout 2021.

For 2021, the company is reiterating guidance with revenue growth projected at 48%. GAAP and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations are estimated to range from $10.55 to $11.15. Lennox International will restart its stock purchase program, planning to buyback $400 million this year.
