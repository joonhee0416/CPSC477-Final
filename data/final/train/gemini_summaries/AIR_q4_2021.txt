AAR reported a 20% decline in annual sales to $1.65 billion and a 39% drop in adjusted earnings per share to $1.31 due to the impact of COVID-19 on commercial air travel. However, the fourth quarter showed signs of recovery with a 5% increase in sales to $438 million and an 81% surge in adjusted earnings per share to $0.47, driven by strong performance in MRO and government contracts. The company attributes its resilience to cost-cutting measures, including facility consolidations and exits from underperforming contracts, which contributed approximately $140 million of annualized pre-COVID sales that will not return as markets recover. AAR's balance sheet remains strong with net leverage at only 0.7 times and over $100 million of cash generated from operating activities during the year. Despite uncertainty surrounding the pace of the commercial air travel recovery, AAR anticipates similar or slightly improved performance in Q1 compared to Q4 and remains optimistic about future growth opportunities based on efficiency gains, portfolio optimization, and a strong government pipeline.
