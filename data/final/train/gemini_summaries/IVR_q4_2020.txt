In Q4, IVR reported a core earnings per share of $0.10, exceeding the recently increased $0.08 dividend. The book value increased by 11.2% to $3.86, resulting in an economic return of 13.5%. The company reallocated to Agency MBS, which now represents 98% of assets, and further reduced its credit book by $336 million. The company remains positive on agency mortgages due to strong demand from the Federal Reserve and commercial banks, as well as attractive funding costs. However, IVR acknowledges potential headwinds due to rich valuations and increased prepayments but mitigates risks through active management and specified pool collateral selection. The company's funding position remains strong with $745 million in cash and unencumbered assets. A successful common stock offering netted $103 million, which was deployed into additional agency mortgages. IVR's outlook is positive, with confidence in strong funding costs and demand for Agency MBS despite potential challenges.
