AES continues its strategic growth, recently surpassing its renewable PPA target of 4 gigawatts to 5 gigawatts in 2021. Despite anticipated headwinds in financial markets, the company remains resilient, thanks to proactive risk management and a diversified portfolio. AES Next, the company's innovation incubator, has contributed significantly to shareholder value through investments in Fluence ($6 billion valuation) and Uplight ($1.5 billion valuation). Core business operations drive growth through long-term customer contracts, with nearly 90% of new business stemming from bilateral deals with corporate clients. AES maintains a robust backlog of 9.2 gigawatts of projects, 60% located in the US. The company has taken steps to secure non-Chinese panel supply for its backlog, ensuring reliable project delivery. Its strategic focus on US growth aligns with its goal of achieving 50% of revenue from US renewables by 2025, while reducing coal exposure to under 10%. AES remains committed to its financial targets, including the parent free cash flow target midpoint of $800 million and a dividend payment of $450 million in 2021.
