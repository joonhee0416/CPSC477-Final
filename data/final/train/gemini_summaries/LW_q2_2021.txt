Lamb Weston delivered solid Q2 financial results, with net sales of $896 million despite challenging operating conditions due to COVID-19 restrictions and weather. The decline in sales was primarily attributed to reduced restaurant traffic, impacting fry demand. Gross profit decreased due to higher manufacturing costs from processing older crops and input cost inflation but was partially offset by favorable price mix. Shipments to major QSR chains in the US remained strong, approaching prior year levels. However, demand in Europe softened as governments reimposed restrictions. The company expects softer demand in the near term due to social restrictions and weather but remains optimistic that restaurant traffic will gradually recover by the end of calendar 2021. The company increased its quarterly dividend by 2% and plans to resume its share repurchase program. Lamb Weston is confident in its fundamentals and ability to manage through pandemic impacts, anticipating demand will approach pre-pandemic levels as vaccines become widely available.
