Griffon Corporation reported a strong start to fiscal 2021 with its second quarter revenue and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) significantly exceeding prior-year results by 12% and 109%, respectively. This performance was driven by robust demand for consumer and home building products, as well as strategic actions that optimized the company's business. The cash generation profile and EBITDA margin expansion in both the consumer and home building segments are notable achievements. The AMES strategic initiative, focused on consolidation, automation, and data analytics, remains on track, with annual cash savings and inventory reductions of $30-35 million expected upon completion in 2023. In the Defense Electronics segment, revenue declined due to timing of work and the divestiture of SEG, but an awarded $162 million support contract for maritime surveillance radars provides growth potential. The company's capital structure provides flexibility for acquisitions and dividend payments, with a 39th consecutive quarterly dividend authorized, reflecting an annualized compound growth rate of 17% since 2012.
