Boston Beer Company saw a 24% depletion growth in Q2, driven by Twisted Tea, Samuel Adams, Dogfish Head, and Truly hard seltzer. Despite missing expectations, Truly's depletions grew 2.7 times the hard seltzer category average, with Truly Iced Tea and Truly Punch becoming the top innovations in the overall beer industry. Twisted Tea had double-digit growth, while Angry Orchard faced declines. However, the company encountered challenges, including overestimating Truly's growth, resulting in higher inventory and supply chain costs. Additionally, out-of-stocks for Twisted Tea persist. The hard seltzer category's uncertain outlook prompted the company to adjust capacity and spending plans. Despite challenges, Boston Beer believes in the long-term growth of its portfolio and is investing heavily in its brands, including the recent announcement of new beverages with Beam Suntory. The company reduced its 2021 earnings and shipment growth guidance, with earnings per diluted share now expected between $18 and $22, and shipment increases of between 25% and 40%.
