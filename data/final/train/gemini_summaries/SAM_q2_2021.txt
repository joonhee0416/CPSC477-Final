The Boston Beer Company reported a 27.4% increase in shipment volume for Q2 2021, driven by growth in Truly hard seltzer, Twisted Tea, Samuel Adams, and Dogfish Head brands. However, the company experienced lower-than-expected demand for Truly, leading to higher inventory levels and increased supply chain costs. Despite facing challenges in the hard seltzer category, the company remains confident in Truly's long-term growth potential and plans to continue investing in brand building and innovation. The company adjusted its full-year guidance to reflect the lower demand for Truly and the uncertain outlook for the hard seltzer category. The new guidance includes a decrease in expected earnings per diluted share and advertising, promotional, and selling expenses. The company believes that its diversified brand portfolio and ongoing supply chain transformation efforts will continue to drive long-term growth.
