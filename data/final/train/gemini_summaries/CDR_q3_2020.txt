Despite the challenges of the pandemic, Cedar Realty Trust has demonstrated resilience with several key achievements. The company's focus on grocery-anchored shopping centers and mixed-use urban redevelopment projects proved advantageous during the crisis. Remarkably, the company achieved a collection rate of 91% in the third quarter, significantly higher than the average for retail REITs.

To address its $75 million term loan maturity in February 2021, Cedar has engaged with financial institutions and is exploring secured loans in the amount of $75 million or more. The company has also taken a rigorous approach to G&A expenses, implementing a zero-based budgeting strategy that identified over $2 million in annual savings.

Additionally, Cedar has made significant progress on its redevelopment projects. At Northeast Heights, the company secured a 20-year lease with the District of Columbia for a 260,000-square-foot office building. Furthermore, the company has executed 32 new leases and 24 renewals, maintaining a strong leasing momentum.

The company's focus on tenant support remains strong. Cedar has engaged with over 800 tenants, resulting in 105 deferral and waiver agreements. These agreements have been instrumental in maintaining tenant health and occupancy.

Overall, Cedar Realty Trust has navigated the challenges of the pandemic effectively. The company's strong rent collections, proactive refinancing efforts, G&A savings, and redevelopment progress position it well for the future.
