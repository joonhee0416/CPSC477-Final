PSEG reported Q1 2021 earnings per share of $1.28, up from $0.88 in Q1 2020. The company reaffirmed its full-year non-GAAP operating earnings guidance of $3.35 to $3.55 per share. The positive results were driven by PSE&G and PSEG Power. PSE&G's net income increased 8% due to higher revenue from capital investments and favorable pension results. PSEG Power benefited from higher capacity prices, favorable weather, and higher generation. PSEG continues to invest in its $14-16 billion, 5-year capital program, with 90% directed to PSE&G. The company secured a continuation of zero-emission certificates for its nuclear units through 2025, which will support its goal of becoming a primarily regulated utility with a carbon-free generating fleet. PSEG is exploring strategic alternatives for its solar source portfolio and Fossil generating fleet, expected to reach agreements by mid-year. Despite the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, PSEG expects a significant easing of restrictions in May and anticipates reaching an agreement on its Fossil fleet soon. The company remains confident in its ability to fund its capital program and execute its plans without issuing new equity.
