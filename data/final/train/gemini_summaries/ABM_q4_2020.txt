ABM reported a 9.9% revenue decline to $1.5 billion in Q4, primarily due to the COVID-19 impact on Aviation and Technical Solutions segments. However, Technology & Manufacturing and Business & Industry saw growth. Despite the pandemic, earnings on both GAAP and adjusted basis increased year-over-year, driven by higher margin COVID-related work orders and effective labor management. The company's adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 6.2%, demonstrating consistent strength even with a non-cash reserve taken for a Technical Solutions project. ABM's EnhancedClean service, introduced during the pandemic, generated over $300 million in sales, creating a competitive advantage. The company plans to invest in the first quarter, including IT projects and operational initiatives. For Q1, ABM forecasts adjusted EPS between $0.60 and $0.65 and GAAP EPS between $0.53 and $0.58. The company anticipates organic growth to be similar to Q4, with continued demand for higher margin work orders. Despite economic uncertainty, ABM remains optimistic and plans to provide full-year guidance in Q2 if visibility improves.
