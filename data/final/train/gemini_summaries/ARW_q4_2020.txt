Arrow Electronics reported record-breaking Q4 sales and earnings, surpassing analyst estimates with non-GAAP EPS of $3.17 and sales of $8.45 billion. The company's global component sales surged by 13% year-over-year, with strength in most regions and industries. Enterprise computing solutions also exhibited growth, with higher infrastructure software demand. Notably, global enterprise computing solutions operating margin reached its highest level since 2017 at 6.3%. Arrow's strong financial performance was driven by operating expense efficiency and a favorable mix of higher value component sales. Despite higher demand, the company generated significant operating cash flow and reduced debt by $715 million. Looking ahead, Arrow provided guidance that would set all-time first quarter records for sales and earnings per share. The company remains cautiously optimistic about demand growth in the Americas and Europe and sees potential for further improvements in enterprise computing solutions in 2021. Furthermore, Arrow appointed Sean Kerins as Chief Operating Officer to lead the convergence of semiconductor and electronic component industries with information and operational technology industries.
