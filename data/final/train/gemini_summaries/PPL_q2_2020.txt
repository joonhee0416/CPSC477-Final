PPL announced plans to sell its U.K. business, WPD, as part of a strategic repositioning to focus on U.S. rate-regulated assets and enhance sustainable energy investments. The sale is expected to strengthen PPL's balance sheet and support its long-term earnings growth through U.S. asset acquisitions or shareowner returns. Management believes WPD will attract a premium valuation given its strong performance and the sector's attractiveness.

Despite the impact of COVID-19, PPL reaffirmed its 2020 earnings forecast of $2.40 to $2.60 per share, expecting the impact to be manageable. The company experienced lower sales volumes in the quarter, primarily due to COVID-19, which was partially offset by hedge gains and higher margins. The sale of WPD will result in the withdrawal of 2021 guidance, which will be updated at the conclusion of the sales process expected in the first half of 2021.

PPL aims to leverage its operational excellence to drive further value for customers and shareholders. The company is also focused on reducing its carbon footprint through accelerating the decarbonization of its Kentucky fleet with economic benefit for customers. Management believes the strategic repositioning will enhance PPL's ability to deliver long-term value to shareowners and customers.
