In Q2, U.S. Bancorp reported an EPS of $1.28, with net revenue of $5.8 billion. Notably, the company released $350 million in loan loss reserves due to an improved economic outlook and strong credit quality. Net interest income grew, driven by higher yields and favorable mix shifts. Non-interest income saw an uptick of 10% due to increased business and consumer spending. The Payment Services business performed well, with all three divisions (credit and debit card, merchant acquiring, and corporate payment systems) exceeding pre-pandemic sales volumes. Overall, expenses remained stable, and the CET1 capital ratio reached 9.9%, exceeding the target of 8.5%. The company expects continued growth in sales volumes and industry-leading returns on equity in the coming quarters. Credit quality is expected to remain strong, with a lower-than-normal net charge-off ratio. The company remains optimistic about the economic recovery and its position to capitalize on the cyclical upturn.
