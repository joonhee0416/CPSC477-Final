Despite revenue headwinds due to pandemic-related delays, Comfort Systems USA reported solid second-quarter results with increased backlog, strong service revenue, and a neutral to slightly accretive acquisition of Amteck. The company's backlog increased by $180 million on a same-store basis, driven by growth in industrial projects, with industrial activities now constituting 42% of total revenue. Service revenue also rebounded, offsetting construction air pockets. The Mechanical segment performed well, with Electrical gross margins improving. Despite challenges in the third quarter due to tough comparisons, Comfort Systems remains optimistic about its prospects with strong underlying trends, increased backlog, and a robust pipeline. The company expects stronger activity levels later this year and into 2022, particularly in industrial and service sectors.
