Assuring Guaranty's second quarter performance exceeded expectations, with adjusted book value surpassing $100 per share for the first time. This milestone was achieved alongside strong new business production, particularly in U.S. public finance, where direct PVP reached $96 million, a 71% increase over Q2 2019. The heightened demand for bond insurance due to increased credit scrutiny and economic uncertainties significantly aided Assured's growth. Notable transactions included the insuring of a $385 million school district transaction and over $1 billion of AA-rated primary market par. International infrastructure and global structured finance businesses also performed well, contributing to overall revenue growth. Despite continued stress in the Puerto Rico market, Assured remains optimistic about resolving the situation through a consensual agreement. Additionally, Assured Investment Management benefited from a strong rally in the credit markets, while strategic changes within the leadership team are expected to drive future growth. The company's solid capital position, 96% investment-grade insured portfolio, and ability to work with issuers facing short-term liquidity problems have positioned Assured to thrive in the current market environment.
