In the second quarter of 2020, Tidewater reported a revenue of $102.3 million, a 19% decrease year-over-year. This decline was primarily driven by a decrease in vessel activity, particularly in West Africa and the Europe Mediterranean segment. Despite the challenging environment, Tidewater achieved an operating margin of 35%, resulting in cash from core operations of $117 million. The company anticipates full-year revenue to be approximately $390 million, with cash operating margins still at 35%. To improve cash flow, Tidewater has implemented strategies such as minimizing dry-dock expenses, timely collection of receivables, and disposal of older vessels. The average day rates across the company increased by 3% year-over-year, driven by higher day rates from contracts entered into before the pandemic and a mix shift towards higher-day rate vessels. However, due to impairments and other charges totaling $111.5 million, Tidewater recognized a net loss of $71.7 million for the quarter. The impairments were largely driven by reassessments of the fleet and receivables in Africa, where the oil and gas industry has been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic and downturn in the oil market.
