Asbury Automotive Group delivered an impressive quarter with total revenue of $2.4 billion, a 30% year-over-year increase. Same-store revenue grew 16% with an all-time record gross margin of 20%. New vehicle gross profit per vehicle surged by 97% to $4,808, while used vehicle gross margin reached 8.4%. Asbury's F&I performance was strong, with a $155 increase in per-vehicle retail revenue. The company's acquisition strategy is on track, with $6.6 billion of annualized revenue expected from acquisitions in 2021, including the transformative acquisition of Larry H. Miller Dealerships in the fourth quarter. Clicklane, Asbury's online retail platform, continues to perform well, with 6,000 vehicles sold in Q3 and an average transaction time of 8-14 minutes. The company's balance sheet remains strong, with a net leverage ratio of 1.2 times and liquidity of approximately $780 million. As a result of the acquisition pipeline, Asbury expects to leverage temporarily above its target of three times but aims to deleverage to three times in 2023 due to the accretive nature of the deal and strong cash flow generation.
