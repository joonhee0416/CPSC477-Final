For the first quarter of fiscal 2021, ADS saw a 23% increase in net sales, driven by 3% organic growth and the Infiltrator acquisition. Domestic sales increased 4%, with agriculture and construction end markets showing strong growth. Notably, pipe and allied product sales also grew 4%. Profitability surged, with adjusted EBITDA increasing 99% year-over-year, mainly due to favorable material costs, operational initiatives, and synergy programs from the Infiltrator merger. Infiltrator recorded record profitability due to material cost advantages and successful execution of its business model. Despite challenges in recruiting, absenteeism, and reopening processes, ADS remains well-positioned to capitalize on market stability and lower input costs. Its broad product offerings, geographic diversity, and national relationships make it a leading industry partner. The company reported strong free cash flow and lowered its pro forma leverage ratio to 1.9 times, below its target range of 2-3 times. Despite current market uncertainties, ADS is focusing on disciplined execution and capital deployment, emphasizing safety, capacity expansion, and innovation.
