In the fourth quarter of 2020, Carter's reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.46, despite a 10% decline in revenue. This was driven by a 460 basis point increase in gross margin, improved product offerings, price realization, and inventory management.

The company's U.S. retail segment saw higher sales in eCommerce and increased profitability due to improved product margins. U.S. wholesale sales declined due to lower demand and inventory issues, while international sales also faced challenges due to pandemic-related store closures.

For the full year, Carter's achieved record gross margin performance, minimized the impact of lower sales, and generated strong operating cash flow. The company expects continued growth in the coming years, with a focus on leading in eCommerce, winning in the baby market, aging up its brands, and expanding globally.

In 2021, the company projects approximately 5% sales growth, driven by all business segments. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to grow by about 10%, with the first half of the year being the period of more significant growth.

Key challenges facing the company include potential delays in product receipt and rising transportation costs. However, Carter's remains cautious and flexible in its planning, leveraging its strong brand portfolio and multi-channel distribution to weather industry headwinds and capitalize on growth opportunities.
