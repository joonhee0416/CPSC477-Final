Carter's reported strong growth in the fourth quarter despite challenges posed by the pandemic. Sales grew in all segments, with eCommerce sales surging 47% in Canada. Gross profit increased significantly due to higher product margins, improved price realization, and effective inventory management. The company implemented several initiatives to strengthen its online presence, including investing in digital marketing, expanding omni-channel capabilities, and launching a new mobile app. It also closed underperforming stores and plans to continue this strategy in the coming year. Despite lower sales, Carter's achieved good growth in both sales and earnings in 2021, with adjusted earnings per share increasing by 10%. The company remains cautious due to ongoing uncertainty but expects strong growth in the first half of 2022. Key risks include potential delays in product shipments and rising transportation costs.
