The company's organic sales grew by 4% in Q3, driven by price increases and volume gains in North America and double-digit growth in several D&E markets. Despite this, higher inflation and supply chain disruptions led to disappointing margins and earnings. To address this, the company is implementing further pricing actions, cost-saving measures, and discretionary spending cuts. While some challenges, such as consumer tissue destocking, are expected to subside in 2022, others, including inflation and labor shortages, may persist. The company remains committed to brand investment and commercial execution, believing that its strategy is working and that it can create long-term shareholder value.
