Paymentus reported strong third-quarter results, with contribution profit soaring 37% year-over-year to $40.7 million. This growth was driven by a significant sales quarter, particularly a large enterprise deal that could boost revenue by over 400 basis points at full implementation. Paymentus processed over 70 million transactions in the quarter, continuing its impressive growth trajectory and giving it an annualized run rate of 280 million transactions. The company signed over 140 billers in Q3 and has a vast runway for growth, with less than 2% of billers in key market verticals currently using Paymentus services. Paymentus expanded its relationship with J.P. Morgan Chase and saw progress in its integration of Payveris and Finovera acquisitions. The company noted that B2B payment volume and IPN network payment volume both surpassed $1 billion on an annualized run rate basis, demonstrating the success of its multi-product strategy. Despite increased operating expenses, Paymentus raised its full-year revenue and contribution profit outlook and reaffirmed its adjusted EBITDA outlook, indicating confidence in its ongoing growth prospects.
