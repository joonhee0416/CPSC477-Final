MarineMax achieved record revenue and gross margins in fiscal 2021, with strong performance in Q4 despite supply chain challenges. Same-store sales decreased 7% in Q4 and 13% for the full year, attributed to inventory shortages. However, demand remained robust, as evidenced by a surge in customer deposits. The company's strategic acquisitions continue to exceed expectations and contribute to margin expansion, with each acquired company outperforming its previous record. MarineMax's focus on high-margin businesses has driven operating margin growth to over 10%, nearly double the 2019 level. Despite supply chain headwinds, revenue is expected to grow 10% in fiscal 2022, with earnings per share guidance of $7.20 to $7.50. The company's strong balance sheet and global presence position it well for sustained growth and shareholder value creation.
