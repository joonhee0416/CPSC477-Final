National Fuel Company reported strong earnings for fiscal year 2021, with operating results of $0.95 per share in the fourth quarter, driven by improved commodity prices, Appalachian acquisition benefits, and pipeline expansion projects. For fiscal 2022, earnings are projected to increase by 14% to $5.05-$5.45 per share due to increased commodity price assumptions and a modest rise in Seneca's LOE. The company expects to generate $320 million in free cash flow at $4.50 natural gas prices, prioritizing debt reduction, growth projects, M&A, and shareholder returns. National Fuel is committed to sustainability by reducing methane intensity and pursuing certifications for environmentally responsible gas production. The company also emphasizes the importance of future free cash flow, providing flexibility for continued investments and shareholder value creation.
