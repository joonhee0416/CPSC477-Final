Cousins Properties reported solid Q4 results with FFO of $0.68 per share. Despite pandemic challenges, the company leased 387,000 square feet and collected 99% of total rent, including 99% from office customers. Cousins' strategy remains focused on its premier Sunbelt portfolio, with significant investments in Charlotte, including the acquisition of the RailYard for $201 million. The company's balance sheet remains strong with low leverage and ample liquidity. However, 2021 is expected to be a transitional year with occupancy expected to be lower than 2020 due to known vacancies in value-add investments. Cousins is optimistic about long-term value creation as it leases up these vacancies. The company also reported solid same-property cash NOI growth in 2020, increasing 0.7% and a more impressive 4.5% when adjusting for COVID-related deferrals and parking losses.
