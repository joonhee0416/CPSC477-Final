PSEG reported non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.70 per share for the second quarter of 2021, a decrease from $0.79 per share in the previous year. Despite a net loss of $0.35 per share in GAAP results due to transition charges at PSEG Power, the company's results for the first half of 2021 reflect a 9% increase in non-GAAP operating earnings to $1.98 per share, driven by growth in regulated operations and derisking at PSEG Power. The company has made progress in its strategic review of non-nuclear generation assets, with the marketing of fossil assets garnering significant interest. PSEG has reached an agreement with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities and the Division of Rate Counsel on PSE&G's transmission rate, which, if approved by FERC, will reduce PSE&G's annual transmission revenue requirement and provide a rate reduction for customers. PSE&G's electric sales adjusted for weather increased by nearly 4% over the second quarter of 2020, led by an 11% increase in commercial sales. PSEG's existing solar programs are fully subscribed, and the company is working on developing new programs that can help meet solar goals in the Energy Master Plan. PSEG has closed on its 25% equity stake in the 1,100-megawatt Ocean Wind project in New Jersey, retired its last coal unit at Bridgeport Harbor in Connecticut, and moved up its net-zero vision to 2030. The company is preparing to bid into a competitive process to build Offshore Wind transmission infrastructure. New Jersey's recent endorsement of the environmental benefits provided by its nuclear plants extends the $10 per megawatt-hour carbon-free attribute recognition through May 2025, which allows for time to work on a long-term economic solution to keep the merchant nuclear fleet economically viable.
