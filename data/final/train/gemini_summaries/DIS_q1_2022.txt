In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, Disney's adjusted earnings per share surged from $0.32 to $1.06. Streaming services continued their impressive growth, adding 11.8 million Disney+ subscribers, bringing the total to 196.4 million. Among the highlights were Disney+'s record-breaking success with the film "Encanto" and ESPN+'s 14% increase in advertising revenue. Despite the Omicron surge, domestic parks and resorts posted all-time revenue and income records, thanks in part to the strategic use of Genie+ and Lightning Lane. The company remains optimistic about its future, citing its strong storytelling capabilities, diverse revenue streams, and popular entertainment offerings. However, it acknowledges that the ongoing pandemic and its impact on theatrical releases and international parks could present challenges in the near future.
