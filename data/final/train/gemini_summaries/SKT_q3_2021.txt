During Q3 2021, Tanger Outlets performed well, with occupancy returning to pre-pandemic levels (94.3%) and rent spreads improving on a cash basis by 240 basis points year-over-year. Tenant sales reached a new high of $448 per square foot, an increase of 13% over the same period in 2019. The company's focus on non-apparel and footwear tenant diversification and non-rental revenue growth is paying off, with categories like furniture, home goods, wellness, and beauty adding to the portfolio. Marketing partnerships and onsite events have doubled revenue from 2020 and increased by 38% compared to 2019. Core FFO per share for the quarter was $0.47, excluding a charge for debt extinguishment, and the company raised its guidance for the year to a range of $1.67 to $1.71 per share, reflecting improved variable rents and a potential for additional bankruptcies or brandwide restructurings.
