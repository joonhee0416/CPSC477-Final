Tanger Outlet's fourth-quarter core funds from operations per share reached $0.54. Despite challenges, they have experienced positive traffic trends, with 95% of stores open and 95% rent collection. Leasing momentum remains strong, with additions of notable brands like Tory Burch and Victoria's Secret. Tanger has a well-positioned balance sheet with over $680 million in liquidity and no significant debt maturities until 2023. They have also implemented cost-cutting measures, resulting in approximately $18 million in savings. Tanger is focused on rebuilding occupancy and anticipates pressure on rent spreads due to vacancies. They prioritize investments in portfolio growth, debt reduction, and selective growth opportunities. For 2021, Tanger expects core FFO per share between $1.47 and $1.57, assuming no further government-mandated shutdowns.
