Lincoln Financial Corporation delivered strong underlying earnings despite pandemic-related claims impacting Q4 results. The company's reprice shift and new product strategy, coupled with expense savings initiatives, have strengthened its portfolio and enhanced customer value propositions. Notably, annuity sales reached $5 billion in 2020, with the rollout of eight new products planned for 2021. Lincoln's digital tools and capabilities have significantly enhanced the customer experience and improved productivity. The balance sheet remains robust, with strong free cash flow generation and a high-quality investment portfolio. The company is well-positioned for growth in the coming years, targeting 8% to 10% annual earnings per share growth. Favorable developments such as vaccine rollouts and increasing interest rates bode well for Lincoln's long-term prospects.
