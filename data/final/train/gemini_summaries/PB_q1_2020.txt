Prosperity Bancshares reported a strong first quarter, driven by the acquisition of LegacyTexas. Net income surged by 17.8% to $130 million, while earnings per diluted common share grew to $1.39, reflecting an increase of 8.5% from LegacyTexas's accretion and $101.1 million in loan discount accretion. The bank's core net interest margin improved to 3.36% from 3.16% last year. Noninterest expense rose due to the merger, but the bank expects normalized expense to range from $120 million to $125 million in Q2. Asylbek Osmonov noted an increase in nonperforming assets to $67 million or 25 basis points of quarterly average interest-earning assets, primarily due to the merger. Prosperity increased its allowance for credit losses to $327 million, adopting the CECL accounting standard. The bank processed thousands of SBA PPP applications and remains optimistic about its long-term future.
