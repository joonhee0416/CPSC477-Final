AMETEK's second quarter performance exceeded expectations, with record sales of $1.39 billion, up 37% year-over-year, driven by organic growth, acquisitions, and favorable exchange rates. Orders grew significantly by 92%, leading to a record backlog of $2.5 billion. Operating income also surged by 40% to a record $317 million, expanding operating margins by 40 basis points. Excluding acquisitions, core margins increased significantly by 160 basis points. The company's strategic acquisitions are integrating well and contributing to growth. Despite supply chain challenges, AMETEK's operational excellence initiatives have resulted in $145 million in savings for the year. Given this strong performance, AMETEK has raised its full-year sales guidance to approximately 20% growth and earnings guidance to a range of $4.62 to $4.68 per share, representing a 17-18% increase. The company remains well-positioned for continued growth, with strong cash flow generation, a healthy balance sheet, and a robust acquisition pipeline.
