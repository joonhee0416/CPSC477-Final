CNX's first quarter results demonstrate consistent execution and financial strength. The company generated $101 million in free cash flow and increased its guidance to $450 million, highlighting its ability to generate substantial free cash flow over the next seven years. CNX's key differentiator is its low production cash costs, averaging $0.66 per Mcfe in Q1, enabling it to generate more operating cash flow and free cash flow than peers. Additionally, the company continues to reduce its debt and return capital to shareholders through share buybacks, with ample remaining capacity under its stock repurchase program. CNX's hedging program ensures revenue protection, with 94% of 2021 gas volumes hedged at $2.48 per Mcf. The company's superior conversion of production volumes to free cash flow and low reinvestment rate support its long-term goal of averaging $500 million in annual free cash flow. CNX emphasizes ESG through tangible, impactful, and local efforts, including reducing Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions by over 90% since 2011, capturing nearly as much methane annually as the largest waste management company, and committing $30 million to community investments. CNX continues to chart its own course, prioritizing shareholder value through responsible financial management and innovation in ESG practices.
