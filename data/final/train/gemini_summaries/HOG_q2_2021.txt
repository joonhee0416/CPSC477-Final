Harley-Davidson reported a strong performance in the second quarter of 2021, despite ongoing supply chain challenges. Total revenue surged 77% year-over-year to $1.5 billion, while adjusted earnings per share reached $1.41. This growth was driven by increased motorcycle unit mix, reduced sales incentives, and lower operating expenses. The Motorcycles segment saw a 14.5% increase in gross margin to 30.6% due to favorable unit mix and volume leverage. The Financial Services segment reported a 9% increase in income, boosted by higher net interest income and reduced loan loss provisions. The company expects its Motorcycle segment revenue growth to be 30% to 35% for the full year, and its Financial Services segment operating income growth to be 75% to 85%. Harley-Davidson also announced the launch of several new initiatives, including the H-D Certified pre-owned program, the LiveWire EV brand and its first electric motorcycle, LiveWire ONE, and the H-D1 Marketplace for used Harley-Davidson motorcycles. The company remains optimistic about its future prospects and expects to continue to enhance desirability and expand its global market share.
