Worthington Industries reported strong financial results for Q3, with earnings per share of $1.27, up from $0.27 in the same quarter last year. Excluding one-time items, earnings were $1.36 per share, a record for the company. Net sales were relatively flat at $759 million. The Steel Processing segment drove growth, with record operating income due to higher prices and inventory holding gains. The Pressure Cylinders segment faced headwinds from the divested oil and gas business but still saw improvements in industrial and consumer products. The company also announced the sale of two unprofitable businesses and the acquisition of two strategic ones, enhancing its position in specialty tools and hydrogen technologies. Worthington is well-positioned for future growth, with a strong balance sheet, a growing pipeline of M&A opportunities, and a commitment to rewarding shareholders through dividend increases.
