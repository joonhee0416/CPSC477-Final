Worthington Industries reported strong financial results in Q3, with a significant increase in earnings per share to $1.27, largely due to inventory holding gains and increased demand across end markets. The Steel Processing segment drove record operating income, benefiting from higher spreads and arbitrage gains. Despite challenges in the Pressure Cylinders business, the company remains optimistic, having divested underperforming businesses and made strategic acquisitions to enhance its growth prospects. Adjusted EBITDA reached a record $126 million, and the company generated $9 million in cash flow from operations. Worthington has a strong financial position, with $650 million in cash and a balanced approach to capital allocation. The company has increased its stock repurchase authorization to $10 million shares and declared a dividend of $0.28 per share, marking the 11th consecutive year of dividend growth. Management remains confident in the company's growth initiatives and its ability to navigate operational challenges, and they anticipate a return to a more normal business environment in the coming months.
