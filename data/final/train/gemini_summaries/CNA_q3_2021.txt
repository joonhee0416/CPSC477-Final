CNA's third-quarter performance was marked by improved underlying underwriting performance and favorable Life & Group results, driving a 23% increase in core income. Despite elevated catastrophe activity, the company's core income rose to $237 million or $0.87 per share. Net income for the quarter was $256 million or $0.94 per share. Gross written premium, excluding captive business, grew by 10%, fueled by strong new business growth and continued price increases.

Underwriting results were strong, with an all-in combined ratio of 100%. The P&C underlying combined ratio reached a record low of 91.1%, a 1.5-point improvement over last year. The underlying loss ratio also improved by 0.3 points, to 60.2%. Loss cost trends have increased due to supply chain shortages, but earned rates remain well above loss cost trends, portending continued progress toward margin building.

Specialty and international operations also saw improvements, with underlying combined ratios of 89.6% and 91%, respectively. Commercial operations' underlying combined ratio improved by 1.2 points, excluding COVID-19 frequency impacts.

Production statistics were positive, with P&C gross written premiums growing by 10% ex-captive, driven by 24% new business growth and 8% written rates. Commercial operations led the growth, with 21% growth in new business and 3 points of retention improvement. International operations also grew by 16%, excluding currency fluctuations.

Life & Group reported favorable results, with core income of $41 million. The Annual Gross Premium valuation analysis showed a reserve margin of $72 million. The long-term care claims reserve review resulted in a $40 million pre-tax benefit.

The company remains bullish about the market, with expectations that written rate increases will persist above loss cost trends in 2022. This is due to headwinds such as social inflation, elevated catastrophe activity, low interest rates, and economic inflation from supply chain dynamics.
