Despite pandemic-related challenges, Coca-Cola reported encouraging first-quarter results, showing signs of broader recovery on the horizon. Global unit case volume remained flat compared to the challenging first quarter of 2020, but March volume recovered to 2019 levels, driven by strength in Asia Pacific. Organic revenues increased 6%, with concentrate shipments up 5% and price/mix improvements of 1%. Amidst improving trends and the continued strength of at-home channels, the company maintained its full-year guidance, expecting high single-digit organic revenue growth and high single-digit to low double-digit comparable earnings per share growth. COVID-19 vaccination efforts and other initiatives are underway to support recovery and address uncertainties. The company remains confident in its ability to navigate market challenges and deliver 2021 earnings at or above 2019 levels.
