MSA returned to revenue growth in Q2, with revenue increasing 5% to $341 million. Core product revenue rose 12%, driven by strong growth in fire service and industrial PPE. Margins remained stable despite inflationary pressures, and the company implemented an off-cycle price increase to mitigate these costs. While supply chain challenges with electronic components continue to impact backlog, incoming orders surpassed 2019 levels. The acquisition of Bacharach is expected to contribute $0.10 to $0.15 of adjusted earnings per share in H2 2021. MSA's balance sheet remains strong, with net debt-to-EBITDA at 1.7 times pro forma after the Bacharach acquisition. The company's focus going forward will be on acquisition integration, pricing adjustments, supply chain navigation, and maintaining leadership positions in core markets. Despite the challenging supply chain environment, MSA remains confident in its long-term future due to its strong innovation engine, continuous improvement culture, and strategic use of its balance sheet for acquisitions and investments.
