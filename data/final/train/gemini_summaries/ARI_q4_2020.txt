Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance (ARI) navigated 2020 successfully by focusing on balance sheet durability and proactive asset management. The company's liquidity was enhanced through effective relationships with lenders and opportunistic asset sales. ARI's asset management efforts benefited from investment in talent and systems, as well as the involvement of originators in transactions.

Despite ongoing challenges in the hospitality sector, the overall credit quality of ARI's portfolio remains stable. The company's proactive approach to managing its largest loans, including the Miami Design District and Fulton Street developments, has yielded positive results. ARI remains well-positioned to capitalise on the increase in real estate transaction activity, supported by low interest rates and ample dry powder in real estate funds.
