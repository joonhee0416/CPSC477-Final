The company reported a nearly 25% year-over-year increase in adjusted EBITDA during the first half of 2021, resulting in the best financial results in the last six years. Despite facing challenges such as production interruptions and unfair trade practices, the company believes market conditions will remain favorable through at least 2023, driven by strong agricultural and industrial demand for nitrogen. The company is well-positioned to capture this demand with its cost-advantaged network and is taking steps to address unfair trade practices in the UAN industry. Additionally, the company is pursuing clean energy initiatives and expects increased demand for ammonia in the coming years. With a focus on investment-grade metrics and significant free cash flow generation, the company is well-positioned for continued shareholder value creation.
