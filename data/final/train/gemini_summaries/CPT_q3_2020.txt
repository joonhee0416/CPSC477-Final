Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, Camden Property Trust reported strong third-quarter results, with funds from operations (FFO) of $1.25 per share, exceeding guidance by $0.08. This outperformance was driven by higher same-store revenue, lower net bad debt, higher occupancy, and increased leasing activity. The company's geographic diversification strategy has helped mitigate the impact of job losses, as most markets have experienced a lower rate of high-paying job losses compared to the national average. Camden's markets also benefited from population and employment growth due to their pro-business environments, educated workforces, and high quality of life. The company has continued progress on new development projects, including stabilizing one community in Phoenix and completing construction on another in Houston. Occupancy increased to 95.6% in the third quarter, and collections exceeded expectations with 99.4% of scheduled rents collected. For the fourth quarter, Camden anticipates FFO per share in the range of $1.21 to $1.27, with normal seasonal declines offset by the timing of property tax refunds and lower net market rents.
