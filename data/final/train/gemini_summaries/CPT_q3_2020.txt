Camden Property Trust delivered impressive results in Q3, driven by a strong team, capital allocation strategy, and market selection. Geographic and product diversification mitigated earnings volatility, with key markets facing job losses of 2.5%-5% compared to the U.S. average of 15%. Despite the pandemic, occupancy rose to 95.6%, supported by a low turnover rate of 48% and an increase in move-outs to purchase homes. The company completed several new developments and projects, including Camden North End I and Camden Downtown. While effective new leases declined by 2.4%, effective renewals grew by 0.6%, resulting in a blended decline of 0.9% for new leasing. Additionally, third-quarter collections exceeded expectations with 99.4% of scheduled rents collected and only 0.6% delinquent. The company reported FFO per share of $1.25, exceeding guidance and driven by higher same-store revenue, lower bad debt expense, and a gain on the sale of a technology investment. Same-store revenue for 2020 is now expected to increase by 1%, offset by higher expenses, resulting in a 0.3% decline in net operating income.
