MTI's fourth-quarter performance demonstrated the company's resilience amid market challenges. Despite $5 million in reduced income due to inflationary pressures and logistics disruptions, MTI delivered earnings per share of $1.25 (excluding special items), a 16% increase year-over-year. For the full year, MTI posted record sales and earnings, with revenue growing 17% to $1.9 billion and earnings per share increasing 26% to $5.02. Going into 2022, MTI's order books remain robust, with strong demand across its end markets. The company has implemented pricing adjustments and operational improvements to offset ongoing inflationary pressures and anticipates a significant margin expansion in the first quarter, with operating income expected to increase by 15-20%. MTI is well-positioned for continued growth, driven by its balanced portfolio, growth initiatives, and a strong balance sheet that allows for both shareholder returns and strategic acquisitions. The company's focus on sustainability, operational excellence, and a culture of innovation provides a solid foundation for continued success in 2022 and beyond.
