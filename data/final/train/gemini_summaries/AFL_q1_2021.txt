Aflac Incorporated reported a strong start to the year with a 26.4% increase in adjusted earnings per diluted share for the first quarter. This growth was primarily driven by lower benefit ratios associated with the pandemic conditions. Despite the impact of the pandemic on sales, Aflac continues to make progress in platform investment and integration.

In Japan, Aflac Japan generated solid financial results with a profit margin of 23.1%. The company also reported strong premium persistency of 95%. The launch of a new medical product has been well-received, and Aflac is actively working with Japan Post to gradually improve Cancer Insurance sales.

In the US, Aflac US also reported strong profit margins of 27.3%. Premium persistency improved to 80%. Aflac is continuing to invest in virtual sales capabilities and building out its product portfolio. The company recently acquired businesses in network dental and vision, group, absence management, and disability. These acquisitions are expected to drive future growth.

Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, Aflac remains committed to its long-term growth strategy. The company's core earnings drivers continue to produce strong pre-tax margins in both the US and Japan. Aflac expects sequential sales increases in both the US and Japan in the second quarter and anticipates a return to normal benefit ratios as pandemic conditions improve.
