In the first quarter, Aflac reported a 26.4% increase in adjusted earnings per diluted share, with a total EPS of $1.53. The strong performance was primarily driven by lower-than-expected benefit ratios, particularly in the United States, due to the impact of the pandemic on medical utilization. Aflac Japan also reported solid results, with a 23.1% profit margin. Despite pandemic-related challenges that continue to suppress sales, the company remains optimistic and is actively investing in growth initiatives, including a new medical product in Japan and expansion of its US product portfolio with network dental and vision and group, absence management and disability. These investments, coupled with strong core earnings drivers, position Aflac for long-term success as pandemic conditions improve.
