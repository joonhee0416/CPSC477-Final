In Q4 of 2020, Louisiana-Pacific (LP) reported a record quarter for its SmartSide siding, with sales increasing by 30% to $259 million, and OSB prices remained exceptionally high, resulting in $250 million in OSB segment EBITDA. The company's total sales for the year reached $2.8 billion, with EBITDA of $781 million and earnings per share of $4.31.

LP has exceeded its three-year EBITDA improvement target of $165 million a year ahead of schedule, driven by growth, operating efficiency, and strategic sourcing. The company announced a two-phase SmartSide capacity expansion strategy, converting its mills in Houlton, Maine, and Sagola, Michigan, from OSB production to SmartSide. This will add roughly 520 million square feet of SmartSide capacity and remove 670 million feet of OSB capacity.

In addition, LP is restarting production at its Peace Valley OSB mill in British Columbia to meet increasing customer demand. The mill will help balance OSB supply and demand and support the company's goal of becoming a low-cost leader in the industry.

LP's financial performance in Q1 2021 is expected to be strong, with further growth in SmartSide sales and sequential higher OSB sales. The company anticipates adjusted EBITDA for Q1 to exceed $380 million.
