In Q2, World Fuel reported an adjusted EPS of $0.39 and revenue of $7.1 billion, driven by volume increases in all operating segments and higher fuel prices. Aviation segment volume doubled year-over-year, while marine and land segments also experienced growth. Despite the lack of volatility in the marine industry, the company expanded its logistics capabilities and complementary services through its World Connect business. In the land segment, natural gas, power, and sustainability-related offerings gained traction. The company's balance sheet remains strong, with a net cash position of over $200 million, allowing for organic and strategic growth investments. The company expects aviation gross profit to increase in Q3, driven by the recovery in commercial passenger activity. Marine gross profit is projected to rise modestly, while land gross profit is anticipated to be relatively flat year-over-year.
