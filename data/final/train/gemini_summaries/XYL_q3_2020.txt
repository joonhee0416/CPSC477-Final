Xylem exceeded revenue and margin guidance for the third quarter, driven by strong performance in wastewater utilities and residential end markets. Revenue declined 7%, primarily due to expected declines in metrology project deployments and industrial and commercial businesses. Despite the pandemic's impact on some markets, the company saw solid recovery in China, where revenue grew 17%. Operating margins expanded quarter sequentially to 13%, driven by productivity and cost reductions. The company has a strong liquidity position, with approximately $1.6 billion of cash and $2.4 billion of liquidity. Xylem anticipates quarter sequential improvements in the fourth quarter, with operating margins expected to be in the range of 13 to 13.5%. The company expects full-year free cash flow conversion of greater than 100% and reiterates its commitment to sustainable margin expansion and digital adoption in the water sector.
