Endeavor Group reported a strong third quarter, surpassing its revenue and adjusted EBITDA targets due to continued growth in UFC, pent-up demand for entertainment, and the potential of sports betting. UFC posted record revenue and adjusted EBITDA despite fewer events, driven by sold-out Pay-Per-Views, VIP experiences, and increased sponsorship revenue. The company's events, experiences, and rights segment benefited from the return of live events, with major events like Wimbledon, The Open Golf Championship, and the Ryder Cup showcasing Endeavor's multi-platform capabilities. The content and experiential segment also saw growth, with Endeavor Content delivering projects to major streaming services and WME booking major music tours and film releases. The company raised its full-year revenue guidance to between $4.89 billion and $4.95 billion and its adjusted EBITDA guidance to between $835 million and $845 million, indicating a positive outlook for the remainder of 2021.
