Despite a robust oil price environment, the energy industry is experiencing a degree of capital discipline, limiting near-term growth prospects. H&P's financially strong position has enabled them to execute on strategic objectives, including the development of value-added digital technology solutions and innovative commercial models. H&P has seen success with these new models, with approximately 30% of their active U.S. fleet currently under some type of performance contract, up from 10% a year ago. Their digital technology provides automation solutions that improve wellbore quality and lead to cost savings and economic benefits for customers. H&P's FlexRig solutions have contributed to an increase in their U.S. rig count by 25% since the end of fiscal Q1, and they hold leading market shares in both public and private E&P. However, rising demand has led to an increase in rig reactivation costs, prompting H&P to anticipate that the market will soon reach an inflection point where customers will bear some of this financial burden. The company remains optimistic about the future of the oil and gas industry and is well-positioned for international growth opportunities. H&P's financial position remains strong, with cash and short-term investments exceeding $562 million and low debt metrics. They have also extended the maturity of their revolving credit facility to November 2025.
