Western Alliance achieved record net income of $135.8 million in Q3, driven by robust balance sheet growth, prudent provision reflecting asset quality, and strong net interest income and PPNR. Total loans grew by $985 million, mostly in low-loss asset classes such as warehousing lending. The company's provision for credit losses decreased to $14.7 million, primarily due to improved macroeconomic forecasts and loan growth in low-risk asset classes. Despite a temporary decline in net interest margin, it is expected to rise to 3.9% in Q4, supported by balance sheet growth and deposit seasonality. Western Alliance continues to generate significant excess capital, with tangible book value per share increasing to $29.03, reflecting a 13.4% year-over-year rise. The company's strong balance sheet and access to liquidity provide flexibility for future growth and shareholder returns. Western Alliance's proactive credit risk mitigation efforts and close monitoring of impacted industries, such as gaming, technology and innovation, CRE retail, and hotel franchise finance, have contributed to its strong credit position. The company's long-term outlook remains positive, with loan growth expected to return to pre-pandemic levels and PPNR projected to increase in Q4 and beyond.
