Genie Energy achieved notable growth in its customer base, adding 21,000 net RCEs and 22,000 net meters during the quarter. By quarter-end, it boasts the largest customer base in its history, including 92,000 RCEs and 182,000 meters internationally. Amidst pandemic-related challenges, Genie Retail Energy (GRE) domestically expanded by 7,000 RCEs and 1,000 meters, with gross domestic meter additions reaching 44,000. Improved bottom line results were driven by a surge in average electricity consumption per meter, which offset margin declines. Genie International saw strong customer base expansion, particularly in Scandinavia and the U.K., where the company acquired its joint venture partner's stake for $1.7 million and will consolidate Orbit Energy's results as a wholly owned subsidiary in Q4. Consolidated revenue increased 12% year-over-year to $96 million, and earnings per diluted share rose to $0.24. The company's balance sheet was also strengthened, with cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reaching $49 million.
