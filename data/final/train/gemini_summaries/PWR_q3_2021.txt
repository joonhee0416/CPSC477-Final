Quanta Services reported record third-quarter revenues of $3.4 billion, driven by strong demand for utility and communication services. Electric Power Solutions revenue increased 10% to $2.3 billion, benefiting from $230 million in emergency restoration revenues. Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions revenue climbed 12% to $1.02 billion, primarily due to growth in gas distribution and industrial services. Adjusted diluted EPS was $1.48, surpassing earlier expectations. Total backlog reached a record $17 billion, with the addition of Blattner's $1.8 billion backlog expected to further enhance Quanta's positioning. The company sees favorable market dynamics, including the need for renewable energy infrastructure, grid modernization, and environmental initiatives. Quanta's full-year revenue guidance is $12.55 billion to $12.85 billion, with adjusted EBITDA between $1.21 billion and $1.26 billion. The acquisition of Blattner, a utility-scale renewable energy solutions provider, is expected to contribute to long-term growth and enable Quanta to capture opportunities in North America's energy transition.
