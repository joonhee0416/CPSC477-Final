LyondellBasell's first quarter of 2021 showcased significant growth, with earnings more than doubling year-over-year to $3.18 per share. Strong demand and tight markets contributed to improved margins across several segments. The Olefins and Polyolefins-Americas segment achieved its highest quarterly EBITDA since 2015, while the O&P-Europe, Asia, and International segment had its highest since 2018. Cash generation enabled a $500 million debt paydown in January and a similar amount in April. The company prioritizes further debt reduction in 2021 to strengthen its investment-grade balance sheet. Low inventories, high demand, and deferred maintenance from 2020 are expected to sustain tight markets and strong margins through at least the end of the year. LyondellBasell's expanded asset base, including joint ventures and next-generation technology, positions it to capture opportunities in the recovering economy, with potential for new earnings benchmarks. The company remains committed to deleveraging, supporting shareholder returns, and maximizing free cash flow. The outlook for the business is promising, with anticipation of continued delivery on commitments in the coming quarters.
