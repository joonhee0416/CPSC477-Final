Cohen & Steers reported record earnings of $1.06 per share in Q3 2021, driven by higher average assets under management and one additional day in the quarter. Revenue was also a record at $154.3 million. Operating income reached $70.4 million, resulting in an operating margin of 45.6%. Despite a 2.6% increase in expenses, the compensation-to-revenue ratio improved to 34.5%, and the effective tax rate remained at 26.5%. Total assets under management increased to $97.3 billion, with advisory accounts experiencing net outflows of $311 million primarily due to a termination from an unexpected client decision. Japan Subadvisory and Subadvisory, excluding Japan, also recorded net outflows. Open-end funds, however, had net inflows of $2 billion, primarily into U.S. real estate and preferred funds. With a strong outlook for real assets, Cohen & Steers is launching a closed-end fund combining public and private real estate in February 2022 and expanding its private real estate strategies.
