MDU Resources reported mixed results for Q3 2021, with strong performance in its Regulated Energy Delivery business offsetting headwinds in Construction. The company's earnings per share of $0.68 came in lower than the previous year's $0.76 but remained above analyst estimates. The Construction Services segment faced challenges with higher labor costs and project revisions, leading to a decrease in earnings and a downward adjustment in revenue and margin guidance. Construction Materials also experienced lower asphalt sales and margins due to increased oil and diesel costs, resulting in a revision to margin guidance. Despite these challenges, the Regulated Energy Delivery business reported strong earnings, driven by increased electric retail sales volumes and a natural gas pipeline expansion project. MDU Resources is optimistic about future growth potential, with the allocation of American Rescue Plan Act Funds and a potential federal infrastructure plan expected to benefit their construction operations. The company continues to seek acquisition opportunities and is committed to operational integrity and shareholder value.
