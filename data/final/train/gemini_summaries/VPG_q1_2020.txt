Despite challenges stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, Vishay Precision Group (VPG) exhibited resilience in the first quarter of 2020. VPG's revenue declined 11.5% year-over-year to $67.7 million, yet the company reported diluted earnings per share of $0.24, driven by diverse markets and strategic initiatives. The company's strong balance sheet, with net cash of $42 million and a newly established revolving credit facility, provides financial flexibility. VPG expects a reduction in revenue for the second quarter due to the shutdown of its Indian facility, estimating a $5 million to $7 million loss for Force Sensors. However, the company remains confident in its long-term strategy and is actively pursuing key initiatives to drive growth and reduce operating costs. Despite the uncertain macroeconomic outlook, VPG anticipates a return to normalized economic conditions and is well-positioned to succeed.
