Southwest Gas Holdings reported a net loss for the third quarter of 2021, primarily due to a $5 million legal reserve and one-time transaction costs from the Riggs Distler acquisition. However, the company's long-term outlook is positive. The planned acquisition of Questar Pipeline is expected to be accretive to earnings in 2022, and Riggs Distler is anticipated to contribute to earnings in the same year. Additionally, Southwest Gas Holdings has experienced strong customer growth in its natural gas distribution business, with 37,000 new meter sets added over the past year. The company's regulatory partnerships have also been successful, with recent rate cases resulting in increased revenues of approximately $66 million. Southwest Gas Holdings is committed to customer satisfaction, with high marks in customer surveys, and plans to invest $2.1 billion in capital expenditures over the next three years to support growth and ensure reliable service. The company also announced a dividend of $2.38 per share, which has increased annually for the past 15 years.
