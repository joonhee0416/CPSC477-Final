The company reported strong Q3 results, with revenue growth of 13%, earnings per share growth of 21%, and operating margins expansion of 150 basis points. The company's backlog also reached a record $11.4 billion, up 7% from last year. The company's three technologies, LMR, video security and access control, and command center software, all experienced growth during the quarter. The company is raising its full-year guidance for both sales and EPS based on its strong Q3 results and expectations for the remainder of the year. The company's capital allocation in Q3 included $137 million in share repurchases, $120 million in cash dividends, and $61 million of capex. The company also closed the acquisition of Openpath, invested $50 million in equity securities of Evolv, and subsequently acquired Envysion. The company's Products and Systems segment saw strong growth in EMEA and Latin America, while the Software and Services segment saw strong growth in services and software contracts in North America. The company expects full-year sales to be up 10% to 10.25%, full-year earnings per share between $9 and $9.04 per share, and full-year opex to be $1.95 billion. The company's supply chain constraints continue to impact its LMR business, particularly its PCR business, and it expects to see strong demand for video security and access control software revenue growth to be greater than 35% this year. The company is expanding its relationships within its existing installed base to provide more software and services, and it expects to see an increase in operating margin of 200 basis points year-over-year for the Software and Services segment. The company's strong Q3 backlog in both segments provides significant demand visibility, and it is planning for another year of strong revenue, earnings, and cash flow growth in 2022.
