AAR reported strong results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, with sales up 14% and adjusted diluted earnings per share up 206% compared to the same period last year. The company's commercial sales increased 52%, while government and defense sales decreased 17%. The strong performance was driven by the robust demand for airframe MRO services and the parts businesses, which showed an encouraging indicator of returning demand. The operating margin was 5.5% for the quarter, up from 2.5% last year and 5.2% in the fourth quarter. AAR also generated $18 million from operating activities from continuing operations and reduced the usage of its accounts receivable financing program. The company announced several new business wins, including an exclusive agreement with Arkwin, a TransDigm company to distribute engine actuation and other commercial aviation product, a contract with the Department of Energy for the conversion and delivery of a 737-700 aircraft modified to allow the DoE to quickly transition between passenger and cargo modes, and an extension of its component support program with Volotea, a growing low cost Spanish carrier. AAR also played a critical role in the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, transporting approximately 2,000 U.S. embassy personnel to Kabul International Airport to support their evacuation from the country. Looking forward, AAR expects that demand for its MRO activities will remain strong as airlines continue to focus on readiness to support the recovery in air travel and preserving a healthy maintenance supply chain. The company also expects stable performance in the near term for its part supply business, while the exit from Afghanistan and programs nearing natural completion points will have a near-term impact on its government business.
