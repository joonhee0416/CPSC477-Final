Tanger Outlets reported a strong first quarter with domestic traffic returning to 97% of the 2019 level, despite February traffic being impacted by severe winter weather. The company's focus on rebuilding occupancy, driving leasing, and curating merchandise mix has led to a sustained rebound in traffic. The consolidated portfolio occupancy was 91.7% at the end of the quarter, up only 20 basis points from the end of 2020. The company believes it will continue to see improvement in traffic and sales trends, which will support better rents in the long term. However, in the near term, the company anticipates pressure on retenanting spreads as it fills recaptured space that was at rental rates above the portfolio average. The company collected approximately 95% of contractual fixed rents billed in the first quarter of 2021, with a run rate of 96% of deferred 2020 rents due to be repaid in the first quarter. The company has implemented an ATM program to reduce debt and strengthen its balance sheet, and expects to take a charge in the second quarter of 2021 currently estimated to be approximately $14.1 million. The company's outlook for 2021 remains unchanged, with a core FFO per share guidance range of $1.47 to $1.57.
