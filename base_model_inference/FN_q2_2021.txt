The company had another record quarter with Q2 results that exceeded guidance and supported its longer-term optimism. Revenue in the second quarter was a record $453.8 million, representing year-over-year as well as sequential growth. The company's focus on driving efficiencies helped generate margins that were at their highest levels in over a year, and earnings per share also increased year-over-year and sequentially to a record $1.10. The automotive program was the most significant driver of upside in the quarter, with automotive revenue growing more than 30% from the first quarter and more than doubled from a year ago. The company is optimistic that this momentum in the automotive space will continue into the third quarter. The company expects industrial laser revenue to improve in the third quarter and is optimistic about the longer-term potential for increased outsourcing from this market. In optical communications, the company saw modest growth in revenue in the second quarter, with stronger telecom revenue offsetting continuing softness from datacom products that are deployed inside the data center. The company is optimistic that datacom revenue will show an improvement in the third quarter and that both datacom and telecom revenue should increase sequentially. The company is also expanding its manufacturing footprint, with a new 1 million square foot building at its campus in Chonburi, Thailand, which will increase its global footprint by approximately 50%. The company expects construction to take approximately 1.5 years, which means it could start to see revenue from this facility in approximately two years. The company is excited about the growth from new programs in multiple areas, coupled with its ability to expand margins. The company continues to aggressively pursue new opportunities that will further its position and drive growing revenue and profitability and enhance long-term shareholder value.
