NHI is a senior housing and skilled nursing organization that has been deeply affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The company has been working to keep its senior population safe and smiling during this time, and has published photos of caregivers and residents as a tribute to their efforts. Operators have implemented protocols to prevent the spread of the virus, but this has resulted in a significant downturn in inquiries, tours, and move-ins, leading to a negative impact on occupancy. NHI has received 99.7% of its contractual rent in April and has collected approximately 94% in May, in line with expectations. The company is committed to transparency with the investment community and has enhanced occupancy disclosure on Bickford, Holiday, and Senior Living Communities. NHI has limited visibility to the financial impact of the pandemic and has withdrawn its previously issued 2020 guidance. The company's focus for the more immediate future is to continue funding existing commitments and provide extreme asset management to its operators, while for the longer term, it continues to have conversations with existing and new operators and expects its pipeline to be ready to support significant external growth when some normalcy returns to the market.
