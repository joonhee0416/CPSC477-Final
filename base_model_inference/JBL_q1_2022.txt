Jabil reported strong results for its first fiscal quarter, with $400 million of core operating income on $8.6 billion in revenue, resulting in a core operating margin of 4.7%. The team delivered exceptional results in key end markets, including healthcare, industrial and semi cap, and mobility, despite the chaotic global supply chain environment. The procurement and supply chain team highlighted that demand continues to outstrip supply, particularly as it relates to semiconductors, and that Jabil continues to leverage best-in-class tools and relationships to maximize its allocation and keep the factories in production. For the year, Jabil expects continued supply chain challenges, with some relief toward the back half of the fiscal year. The company's revenue for the first quarter was $8.6 billion, up 9.4% over the prior-year quarter, with GAAP operating income of $350 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.63. Core operating income during the quarter was $400 million, an increase of 9.6% year over year, representing a core operating margin of 4.7%. Core diluted earnings per share was $1.92, a 20% improvement over the prior-year quarter. Jabil's segments, DMS and EMS, also reported strong results, with revenue for the DMS segment increasing by 11.1% on a year-over-year basis and the EMS segment increasing by 7.4%. The company has increased its core earnings per share outlook for the year to $6.55, up $0.20 from its September outlook, and expects to deliver free cash flow in excess of $700 million while maintaining a core margin of 4.5%. Jabil values its role as a responsible and reliable partner to those it serves and is committed to its purpose, which includes keeping its people safe, servant leadership, DE&I, protecting the environment, and giving back to the communities where it lives.
