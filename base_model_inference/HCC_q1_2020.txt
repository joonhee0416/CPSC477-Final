The first quarter of 2020 saw a decrease in net income and adjusted EBITDA for the company compared to the same period in 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by a 31% decrease in average net selling prices and a 13% decrease in sales volumes. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 27% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 48% in the first quarter of 2019. The company's total revenues were approximately $227 million in the first quarter of 2020 compared to $378 million in the same period last year. The average net selling price per short ton decreased approximately 31% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. The company expects the utilization of its NOLs will reduce its federal and state income tax liability to 0 until the NOLs are fully utilized or expired. The company used $5 million of free cash flow in the first quarter of 2020, which was negatively impacted by an increase in net working capital. The company has withdrawn its full year 2020 guidance and is appropriately adjusting operational needs, including managing expenses, capital expenditures, working capital, liquidity, and cash flows. The company has delayed the $25 million budgeted for the development of the Blue Creek project until at least July 1, 2020, and has temporarily suspended its stock repurchase program. The company will continue to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its business for the remainder of the fiscal year and expects to provide further updates to its financial outlook and the development of the Blue Creek project during its second quarter earnings call to be held in late July. The company continues to pay its quarterly dividend at this time, but will continue to monitor liquidity in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.
