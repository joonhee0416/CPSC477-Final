The transcript discusses the financial results of MBIA Insurance Corporation and National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation for the year ended December 31, 2019. The company's main priority is to remediate its Puerto Rico credits, which accounted for approximately half of its total insured Puerto Rico debt service. The company has resolved and extinguished its COFINA exposure, and its remaining Puerto Rico exposure is largely comprised of three Puerto Rico credits: the Commonwealth pre-2011 General Obligation PBA bonds; the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority or PREPA; and the Puerto Rico Highways & Transportation Authority or HTA. The company has a restructuring support agreement for the PREPA bonds that has been approved by the Federal Oversight Management Board in over 90% of the PREPA creditors, but Governor Vazquez and the Puerto Rico Legislature have stated publicly that they do not support the agreement. The company's insured portfolio continues to decline each quarter, with National's insured portfolio declining to $49 billion of gross par outstanding, down $9 billion or 15% from year-end 2018. The company's leverage ratio of gross par to statutory capital declined to 21 to one, down from 23 to one at year-end 2018. The company received as-of-right dividends from National totaling $134 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, with $110 million paid in October and another $24 million paid in November. The company's statutory net income for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $4 million, compared to net income of $9 million for the prior year's comparable quarter. The company paid $393 million of Puerto Rico-related insurance claims on a gross basis related to the January and July scheduled debt service payments in fiscal year 2019, and $59 million in gross Puerto Rico-related claims in January of 2020. As of December 31, 2019, National's total fixed income investment portfolio, including cash and cash equivalents, had a book adjusted carrying value of $2.5 billion.
