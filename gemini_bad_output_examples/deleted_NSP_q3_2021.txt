**Key Highlights:**

Insperity reported strong Q3 results, exceeding expectations with adjusted earnings per share of $0.89 and $60 million of adjusted EBITDA driven by a quick rebound in worksite employee growth and increased revenue per worksite employee. The average number of worksite employees increased 11% year-over-year and 6% sequentially, fueled by net hiring gains, new client sales, and strong client retention.

**Growth Drivers:**

The company's recent growth acceleration is attributed to three primary drivers: new client sales, client retention, and net hiring within the client base. Sales efficiency has improved significantly due to remote selling, technology enhancements, and a maturing sales force. The increased tenure of experienced BPAs has enabled Insperity to pursue double-digit growth in worksite employees without increasing total BPA count at double-digit levels.

**Fourth Quarter and 2022 Outlook:**

Insperity forecasts Q4 average paid worksite employee growth of 11-12% over 2020, resulting in a full-year growth of 7% above previous guidance. Adjusted EBITDA is projected to increase 19-48% in Q4 and 24-65% in adjusted earnings per share. For 2022, the company anticipates a strong start due to a high starting point of paid worksite employees and expects normalized levels for pandemic-related costs such as benefits, unemployment taxes, and operating expenses. Insperity believes it is positioned to capitalize on the high demand for its services amidst a changing workplace and employee expectations.
