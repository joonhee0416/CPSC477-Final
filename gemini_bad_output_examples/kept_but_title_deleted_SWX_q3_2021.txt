**Earnings Call Summary**

Southwest Gas Holdings reported Q3 earnings affected by one-time transaction costs related to the Riggs Distler acquisition, resulting in a consolidated net loss per share of $0.19. However, the company highlighted strong growth from Riggs Distler, which is expected to be accretive to earnings in 2022.

Natural gas distribution operations saw a 10% increase in operating margin, aided by rate relief and customer growth, while infrastructure services revenue increased by 9%. The company plans to acquire Questar Pipeline, which is anticipated to increase earnings and diversify the regulated business mix.

The Riggs Distler acquisition is expected to contribute $600 million in revenue growth through 2024. Centuri's infrastructure services are well-positioned to capitalize on federal infrastructure spending plans and support the energy transition with increased electrical, renewable, and natural gas infrastructure services.

The company's customer growth remains robust, with 37,000 new meter sets added in the past year, and decoupled rate designs in all service territories reduce volatility for customers and the company. The company has a strong liquidity position and plans to fund $2.1 billion in capital expenditures over the next three years largely through cash flow, debt, and equity.

Southwest Gas Holdings expects earnings per share growth of 5-8% in 2022 and 2023. The natural gas utility segment is expected to experience continued rate base growth and capital investment, while the infrastructure services segment anticipates revenue growth of 27-33% in 2022 and 7-10% in 2023. The company believes it offers a compelling value proposition for investors due to its strong and growing businesses, opportunities for increased earnings and dividends, and its commitment to the energy transition.
