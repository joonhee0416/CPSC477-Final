In a solid second quarter, Synovus Forward initiatives and investments drove continued growth and efficiency. Key highlights include:

* Revenue growth in non-PPP loans and fee income sources offset a decline in mortgage activity.
* Improvement in credit outlook with allowance release and reduction in criticized and classified loans.
* Expense discipline resulted in a 5% year-over-year decline in quarterly expenses.
* Net income margin expansion to 3.02%, supported by asset growth, lower deposit costs, and day count impact.
* Total adjusted noninterest revenue remained strong despite normalization of mortgage production.
* Net charge-off ratio stayed low at 0.28%, reflecting a stable economic outlook.
* NPA ratio declined by 4 basis points to 46 basis points, while the ACL ratio excluding PPP loans decreased by 15 basis points to 1.54%.
* CET1 ratio increased to 9.8%, allowing for share repurchases and capital deployment.

Synovus Forward initiatives contributed $75 million in pre-tax run rate benefits in Q2, with $100 million in benefits anticipated by year-end. Efficiency efforts focused on reducing third-party spend, decreasing headcount, and consolidating real estate. New revenue streams were generated through pricing-for-value initiatives, expansion of treasury and payment solutions, and deployment of analytics tools.

The company remains confident in its growth prospects, with continued loan growth, deposit mix improvement, and further expense optimizations planned. Positive operating leverage is a top priority for the remainder of 2021, and the company expects an effective tax rate of 22 to 24%.
