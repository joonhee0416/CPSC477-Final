National Fuel Gas Company's Q3 earnings call highlighted strong performance in its Upstream and Midstream operations, driven by Seneca's increased production and favorable commodity prices. Seneca's production rose by nearly 50%, with operating costs below expectations. To capitalize on higher winter prices, Seneca plans to accelerate completion connectivity and potentially shift some activities forward.

The FM100 pipeline project is progressing well and remains on track for completion in late 2021. This project is expected to generate $50 million in annual revenue and enhance Seneca's production and gathering capabilities.

The company's utility operations continue to reduce emissions through pipe replacement and modernization efforts. Looking ahead to fiscal 2022, National Fuel projects a 12% increase in earnings, fueled by FM100 project benefits, Seneca's production growth, and higher commodity prices.

Despite the company's commitment to reducing emissions, it emphasizes the need for a balanced approach to energy that recognizes the benefits of natural gas. National Fuel is investing in renewable projects and exploring sustainable completion technologies to minimize its environmental impact.

The company's financial position remains strong. It expects $250 million in free cash flow in fiscal 2022, positioning it well to cover dividends, enhance its credit metrics, and potentially make growth investments or return cash to shareholders.
