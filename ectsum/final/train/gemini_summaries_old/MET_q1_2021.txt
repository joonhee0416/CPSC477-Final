MetLife reported robust financial performance in Q1 2021, driven by strong private equity returns and solid business fundamentals. Adjusted earnings surged 39% to $2.20 per share, surpassing expectations. Private equity portfolio returns reached 13.3%, significantly contributing to variable investment income (VII), which accounted for $1.1 billion post-tax. However, elevated COVID-19 claims in the US and Mexico impacted Group Benefits and Latin America, reducing adjusted earnings. Despite the mortality headwinds, underlying business performance remained strong, with solid top-line growth and underwriting discipline. MetLife maintained a healthy cash position, with holding company cash totaling $3.8 billion and two-year free cash flow within its target range. The company returned $1.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, with a second-quarter dividend increase approved. MetLife remains optimistic about the future, citing promising employment growth in the US and the potential for underwriting effects from the pandemic to subside. Additionally, the company is implementing a hybrid workplace model to enhance productivity and employee engagement.
