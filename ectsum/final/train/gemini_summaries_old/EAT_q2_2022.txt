Brinker's second quarter revealed strong performance with comparable restaurant sales growth of 17.7%, driven by improved staffing levels leading up to Christmas. Chili's, the flagship brand, reported a 12.1% increase in comp sales, while Maggiano's saw a significant surge of 78.1%. Despite inflationary pressures, Brinker has implemented incremental price increases, with Chili's menu prices now up over 4%. The company remains focused on hiring and training initiatives, with a 20% improvement in retention rates for new hourly team members using a virtual learning platform. Brinker is also leveraging technology to enhance operations, implementing a handheld system that has increased server earnings by 15% and a new curbside system that has led to a 15-20 point improvement in guest metrics. The company remains committed to growth, with plans for over 20 new full-size Chili's restaurants and the testing of smaller footprint off-premise designs. Virtual brands, including It's Just Wings and Maggiano's Italian Classics, continue to contribute to growth. While the Omicron variant impacted January sales, Brinker remains optimistic about the remainder of the fiscal year as COVID-related disruptions dissipate and the company's growth initiatives take hold.
