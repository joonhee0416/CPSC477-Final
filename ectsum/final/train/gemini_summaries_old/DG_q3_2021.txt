Dollar General reported a 3.9% increase in net sales to $8.5 billion for the third quarter, exceeding market expectations. Despite a 0.6% decline in same-store sales, the company remains confident in its competitive position due to a well-performing price index and the significance of $1 price point products to its customers. The retailer has ambitious plans for 2022, including nearly 3,000 real estate projects and the acceleration of its pOpshelf concept, targeting 1,000 stores by fiscal year-end 2025. Additionally, Dollar General announced plans to enter Mexico with up to 10 stores in 2022, recognizing Mexico's compelling expansion opportunities. The company's financial outlook for 2021 includes net sales growth of approximately 1% to 1.5%, and earnings per share in the range of $9.90 to $10.20, representing a 22% to 24% increase over 2019 adjusted earnings per share. Dollar General's key initiatives, including NCI, pOpshelf, and DG Fresh, continue to drive growth, with NCI contributing a 2.5% total comp sales increase in stores and pOpshelf exceeding expectations both in sales and gross margin. The retailer's priority remains capturing growth opportunities, with plans to open 2,980 real estate projects in 2022, including 1,110 new stores, 1,750 remodels, and 120 store relocations.
