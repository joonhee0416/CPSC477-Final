American Water has received regulatory approval for its acquisition of York Wastewater, which is expected to close in Q2 2022. The company remains in competition to acquire the Chester, Pennsylvania system, having submitted the highest purchase offer. American Water's accelerated capital investment plan emphasizes system resiliency, as evidenced by the flood wall that protected its Central New Jersey plant during Hurricane Ida. This commitment to resiliency has consistently enabled the company to provide essential services during severe weather events. Despite ongoing supply chain challenges, American Water has affirmed its 2021 guidance range.
