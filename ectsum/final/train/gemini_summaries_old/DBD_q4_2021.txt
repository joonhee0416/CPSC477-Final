Diebold Nixdorf's Q4 earnings report highlights the company's resilience and strength in the face of pandemic-related challenges. Despite supply chain disruptions, they shipped more ATMs, self-checkout, and point-of-sale devices than in 2020. Retail demand for self-service solutions has driven growth, particularly in Europe, the United States, and Australia. In banking, cash recyclers remain in high demand as banks automate and optimize their branch footprints. The company's services organization reached a milestone with 150,000 connected banking self-service devices, enabling predictive maintenance and reducing downtime. Notably, Diebold Nixdorf has expanded into EV charging station servicing and has already secured contracts for several thousand in Europe and the US, with a goal to service over 30,000 by year-end. The company also made significant progress in diversity and sustainability, with females accounting for over 60% of senior hires at the vice president level and above and a reduction in carbon emissions. Octavio Marquez will assume the CEO role, bringing a deep understanding of Diebold Nixdorf's business and a focus on customer-centric innovation. The company expects revenue of $4.0-4.2 billion in 2022, despite ongoing supply chain disruptions, and anticipates gross margin expansion and controlled operating expenses, resulting in adjusted EBITDA of $440-460 million.
