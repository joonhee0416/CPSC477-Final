Unum reported adjusted operating earnings per share of $1.03 in the third quarter, fueled by premium growth in core business lines. COVID-19 resurgence had a significant impact, driving higher mortality and benefit ratios, particularly in the Unum US Group Life and Short-Term Disability lines. To mitigate these impacts, Unum is planning to accelerate recognition of the premium deficiency reserve for the Long-Term Care Block and has initiated a $250 million share repurchase program. The company remains optimistic about long-term growth, citing favorable employment trends and positive premium growth momentum. However, future COVID-19 dynamics remain a key factor in determining the company's earnings outlook, which will be updated in the first quarter of 2022.
