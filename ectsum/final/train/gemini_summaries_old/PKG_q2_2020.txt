PCA reported Q2 net income of $132 million ($1.38 EPS), driven by lower prices, mix, and volumes. The Packaging segment performed well, with increased shipments and improvements in efficiency. However, the Paper segment faced challenges due to lower demand and the shutdown of the Jackson mill. The company recognized an impairment charge of $55.2 million related to goodwill in the Paper segment but determined that long-lived assets were fully recoverable. Looking ahead, PCA expects stronger Q3 demand in its Corrugated Products segment but continues to face uncertainty due to COVID-19 and fluctuating shelter-in-place restrictions. The company emphasized its focus on financial strength and managing operations effectively during challenging times. Despite an inability to provide specific guidance for Q3, PCA remains optimistic and well-positioned to navigate the ongoing economic uncertainty.
