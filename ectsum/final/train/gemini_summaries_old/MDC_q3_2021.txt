In the third quarter of 2021, MDC Holdings reported a robust earnings performance, with a 48% increase in net income and a 26% growth in home sale revenue to $1.26 billion. The company's strong financial results were driven by pricing increases, which led to a home sales gross margin improvement of 300 basis points to 23.5%. MDC also maintained cost discipline, with SG&A expenses falling 80 basis points year-over-year. Despite supply chain challenges, order activity remained healthy at 4.1 orders per community per month, with a solid average selling price of $520,000 for delivered homes. The company's financial position remains strong, with a debt-to-capital ratio of 23.7% and ample liquidity to scale operations and pay dividends. MDC continues to expand into new markets, with recent entries into Austin, Texas and Albuquerque, New Mexico. The company's strong land position and robust backlog set it up for continued growth in 2022, with an expected delivery of over 10,000 new homes for the full year.
