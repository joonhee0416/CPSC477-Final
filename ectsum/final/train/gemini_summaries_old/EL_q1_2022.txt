The Estee Lauder Companies reported a strong start to fiscal year 2022, with organic net sales growth of 18% driven by recovery in the Americas and EMEA. Makeup, developed markets in the West, and brick-and-mortar channels saw a resurgence, complementing growth in skincare, fragrance, Mainland China, Travel Retail in Asia Pacific, and global online platforms. Key brands such as Est√©e Lauder, MAC, La Mer, and Clinique performed exceptionally well, with double-digit organic sales growth. The company's diversified growth strategy enabled it to perform well despite the ongoing volatility from the pandemic. Fragrance, led by Tom Ford Beauty and Jo Malone London, was a standout performer, with a double-digit increase. Skincare continued to grow strongly, with La Mer delivering particularly impressive results. Brick-and-mortar retail experienced a strong recovery in markets emerging from COVID-19, while online sales maintained solid growth, particularly in areas with expanded consumer reach and new innovations. The company highlighted its continued investment in sustainable growth drivers, including product quality, consumer engagement, and social impact initiatives. Despite supply chain constraints, the company maintains its forecast of 9-12% organic net sales growth and 11-14% constant currency earnings per share growth for fiscal 2022, although higher transportation and logistics costs are expected to impact profitability in the coming quarters.
