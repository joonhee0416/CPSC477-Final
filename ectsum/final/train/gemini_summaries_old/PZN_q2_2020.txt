In Q2, despite moderate volatility and renewed optimism, Pzena Investment Management's earnings per share of $0.13 slightly exceeded the previous quarter and revenues decreased by 20% to $30.1 million. Assets under management increased to $31.5 billion, driven by market appreciation, but still fell below last year's levels. Pzena's value investing strategy exhibited higher short-term volatility than the market but demonstrated less volatility over the long term. The company emphasized that its recent 10-year performance, marked by higher volatility, may not fully reflect its true investment skill, which is better represented by average 10-year returns. Pzena's belief in value investing remains unwavering, as they believe it allows them to capitalize on undervaluation created by emotional market reactions. While recent net outflows of $0.4 billion were noted, Pzena attributed positive net flows over longer periods to client acknowledgment of their commitment to value discipline. The company's weighted average fee rate remained relatively stable, with minor fluctuations attributed to asset mix and fee arrangements. Operating expenses saw a decrease due to lower employee departures and travel costs. Other income was driven by investment performance. Pzena's financial position is strong, with a significant cash and cash equivalents balance and an ongoing stock buyback program.
