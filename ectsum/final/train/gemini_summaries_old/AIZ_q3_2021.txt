Assurant reported strong third-quarter results, driven by double-digit operating earnings growth in Global Lifestyle. Connected Living and Global Automotive continue to show strong performance, contributing to the company's long-term growth strategy. They have recently been awarded a Bronze accreditation by EcoVadis for their sustainability efforts. Financial highlights include a 12% increase in net operating income per share excluding catastrophes in Q3 and a 10% increase for the first nine months of the year. They are on track to meet their full-year outlook of 10-14% growth in net operating income per share excluding catastrophes, and expect to end the year closer to the top half of this range. Assurant has completed its three-year $1.35 billion capital return objective from 2019 Investor Day, a quarter ahead of schedule, and has returned an additional $900 million to shareholders. In Global Lifestyle, they anticipate high single-digit net operating income growth, excluding cats, as well as share repurchases. Global Automotive continues to be a key growth business, with increased scale and profitability. Global Housing remains on track for another year of better than market returns, with an operating ROE of nearly 15% for the first nine months. Assurant's leadership transition is underway, with Keith Demmings becoming CEO in January. They have announced new appointments to the Management Committee, including Keith Meier as Chief Operating Officer and Martin Jenns as President of Global Automotive. Innovation, talent, and investments in digital capabilities are seen as important drivers of success. Assurant is leveraging its scale and capabilities in trade-in and upgrade programs, and recently signed a multi-year contract with AT&T to manage their device trade-in program.
