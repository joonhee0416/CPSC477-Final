Life Storage's Q1 performance exceeded expectations, with a record occupancy of 94% driving a 20% increase in net effective rates. The company's active acquisition strategy, with 33 stores acquired or under contract, will contribute to immediate growth. The third-party platform also saw strong growth, while Warehouse Anywhere and Lightspeed offerings continue to gain traction. Adjusted funds from operations per share came in at $1.08 for the quarter, an increase of 16.1% year-over-year. Same-store revenue accelerated significantly to 7.3% year-over-year, supported by positive rent roll-up and increased move-in rates. Same-store operating expenses rose by 4.7%, primarily due to higher snow removal costs. Life Storage raised its 2021 guidance, anticipating adjusted funds from operations per share between $4.33 and $4.41, driven by higher revenue expectations and an increased acquisition budget of $550 million to $600 million.
