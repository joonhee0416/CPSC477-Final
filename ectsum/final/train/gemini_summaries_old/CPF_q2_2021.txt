Central Pacific Financial Corp. reported strong second-quarter financial results with record-high pre-tax income. Hawaii's economic recovery is driving growth, with increased tourism and a low COVID-19 infection rate.

ESG initiatives are prioritized, with the launch of a program supporting women entrepreneurs.

Core loan portfolio growth was broad-based, excluding Customer segment. Residential mortgage and home equity portfolios also saw growth. PPP originations were strong, with 4,600 loans totaling over $321 million. Consumer lending programs have resumed in both Hawaii and the Mainland, indicating confidence in economic recovery.

Core deposits increased by $279 million, while the average cost of deposits rose slightly. Net interest income increased due to higher PPP fee income. Net interest margin normalized for PPP declined, driven by MBS premium amortization, excess liquidity, and lower investment and loan yields.

Net charge-offs were minimal, and the allowance for credit losses decreased slightly. The effective tax rate is expected to remain in the 24%-26% range.
