In the fourth quarter of 2020, Lennox International reported continued momentum, with record-high revenue of $914 million, a 3% increase year-over-year. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations rose 18% to $2.89, exceeding the Refinitiv IBES estimate of $884.8 million. The Residential segment experienced strong growth, setting new records for revenue, profit, and margin, driven by double-digit growth in both replacement and new construction. Commercial revenue declined 13% but maintained a higher segment margin of 19.4%. Refrigeration operations saw a 7% increase in revenue and double-digit backlog growth, with expectations for improved segment margin in 2021. Despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the company is well-positioned for a year of strong growth and profitability, with revenue growth projections of 48% and GAAP and adjusted earnings per share in the range of $10.55 to $11.15. Lennox also plans to invest approximately $135 million in capital expenditures, including a third plant in Mexico expected to yield significant savings. The company remains confident and is restarting its stock purchase program, aiming to buy back $400 million in 2021.
