Despite a challenging environment, the company delivered strong results in Q4 with a 45% increase in net income and a 59% increase in diluted earnings per share to $2.04 due to growth in its loan portfolio, revenue, and strong credit profile. Driven by strategic initiatives, the company achieved double-digit year-over-year growth in net finance receivables and quarterly revenue for the third consecutive quarter. This growth outpaced pre-pandemic levels, with loan originations reaching a record $434 million, up 19% year-over-year. The company's credit profile remains robust, with a 30-day delinquency rate below December 2019 levels and a net credit loss rate of 6.4%, improving over the previous year and the fourth quarter of 2019. Key investments include digital prequalification and end-to-end digital lending, leading to a significant increase in digitally sourced originations. The company also expanded its geographic footprint and plans to open additional branches, utilizing a centralized sales and service model to drive growth and operating leverage. The company's balance sheet remains strong, with more than $550 million of unused borrowing capacity, and 78% of outstanding debt carrying a fixed interest rate. Additionally, a new $20 million stock repurchase program has been authorized, and the quarterly dividend has been increased by 20% to $0.30 per share.
