FLEETCOR's Q4 2020 financial performance showed improved trends, with revenue of $617 million (12% decline) and cash earnings per share of $3.01 (5% decrease) exceeding expectations. Organic revenue growth was -8%, mainly due to a 6% decline in same-store sales. The company's Beyond initiatives, which aim to expand services to new segments and offer additional services to existing clients, are progressing. Notable highlights include the acquisition of Roger, which will enhance the company's Corporate Payments business by offering bill-pay services to its SMB fuel card base. For 2021, FLEETCOR forecasts revenue of $2.65 billion (11% increase) and cash earnings per share of $12.50 (12% increase), assuming AFEX acquisition closes in May. The guidance anticipates gradual volume and revenue improvement in the first half, accelerating in the second half as client softness recovery and new sales performance improve. The company also plans to increase expenses in line with business recovery, including sales, marketing, and IT investments to support growth aspirations.
