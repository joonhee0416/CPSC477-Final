The company's second quarter was marked by strong performance, leading to an increase in annual guidance. The company now expects earnings per share to fall between $4.02 and $4.05, with expectations of reaching the upper limit of the range. All business segments are performing well, with superior reliability and customer satisfaction. Economic growth in Wisconsin, driven by commercial and industrial expansion, is boosting sales growth projections. The company's balance sheet remains strong, allowing for ESG progress plan funding without the need for new equity. The ESG plan is expected to drive average annual asset base growth of 7% while improving sustainability through investments in renewable energy and technology. Notably, the company has invested $400 million in the Sapphire Sky Wind Energy Center, which has an offtake agreement with a major high-tech company. They are also on track to build 1,800 megawatts of regulated solar, wind, and battery storage, significantly reducing their carbon footprint. By 2030, only 8% of their regulated electricity supply is projected to come from coal. Additionally, the company is committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions from its generating fleet by 2050 and net-zero methane emissions by 2030. Wisconsin's strong economic recovery, with a 3.9% unemployment rate, is driving customer growth in both electric and natural gas sales. The company's infrastructure segment continues to expand, with a 90% ownership interest in the Sapphire Sky Wind Energy Center. They have eight wind projects in operation or announced, representing $2.3 billion in investment, and plan to invest an additional $1.1 billion in the segment over the next five years. The company has no rate cases currently pending and recently reached a settlement in Michigan that stipulates a 9.85% return on equity.
