Oxford Industries faced challenges in 2019, with declining wholesale sales. However, e-commerce growth offset this, representing 23% of sales. Despite flat adjusted earnings, liquidity remained strong at fiscal year-end.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Oxford has prioritized employee and community health, leading to store and restaurant closures. The company is focused on preserving liquidity, drawing down $200 million from its credit facility. Cost-cutting measures have been implemented, including furloughs and layoffs, reduced marketing expenses, and deferred capital expenditures.

Oxford's strong liquidity position and focus on protecting its brands will enable it to navigate the current crisis. The company remains confident in its ability to deliver long-term shareholder value.
