Cleveland-Cliffs' record-breaking 2021 saw revenue of $20.4 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $5.3 billion, all-time highs. The company's acquisition of FPT contributed to these strong results, along with a disciplined supply strategy.

In Q4 2021, the company generated $1.5 billion in adjusted EBITDA on 3.4 million tons of steel shipments, the second-best quarterly performance in its history. Shipment reduction and service center inventory liquidation led to a quarter-over-quarter decline in EBITDA. However, higher selling prices partially offset the volume and cost impacts. Notably, if existing fixed price contracts had been in place during Q4, adjusted EBITDA would have been almost $500 million higher.

Cleveland-Cliffs' unique position with fixed-price contracts provides significant visibility into 2022 cash flows. Despite lower shipments, the company generated $900 million in free cash flow in Q4, used to acquire FPT and pay down debt. The company's leverage has improved significantly, and it plans to use excess cash flow to repurchase shares and reduce debt.

Looking ahead, the company expects higher selling prices in 2022, despite rising costs. The automotive industry's recovering demand is a key growth driver, as Cleveland-Cliffs supplies almost half of its steel output to the sector. The company's differentiated business model, including fixed pricing and a commitment to environmental sustainability, positions it well for the future.

Cleveland-Cliffs' commitment to ESG is evident in its acquisition of FPT, increased use of prime scrap, and hydrogen integration in its direct reduction plant. The company's environmental initiatives, including low coke rates and reduced Scope 1 emissions, align with its automotive clients' sustainability goals. Additionally, the company's position as the only domestic producer of electrical steels for renewable energy and electric vehicles further supports its long-term growth prospects.
