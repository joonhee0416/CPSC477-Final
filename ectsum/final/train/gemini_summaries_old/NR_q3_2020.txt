Despite ongoing challenges in the oil and gas industry, Newpark's third-quarter performance showed signs of recovery, with both Fluids and Mats segments anticipating improvement in Q4. In Fluids, U.S. land revenues rose 8% sequentially, while industrial cleaning products generated $3 million, exceeding expectations. The Gulf of Mexico faced disruptions due to hurricanes, leading to a revenue decline. Internationally, COVID-19 impacted operations, but the Middle East is expected to rebound in Q4. The Mats segment saw a 5% revenue increase, driven by utility sector demand and product sales. In the near term, Fluids is expected to reach close to EBITDA breakeven in Q4 and return to positive EBITDA generation in Q1 2021. Mats is anticipating a strong Q4, potentially reaching double-digit operating margin. The company remains committed to positive cash flow and debt reduction. It has generated $36 million in free cash flow and reduced its outstanding debt by $65 million since the beginning of the year.
