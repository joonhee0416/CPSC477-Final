CBIZ reported impressive third quarter results, driven by strong demand for core essential services as well as project-oriented advisory services. The company's Financial Services and Benefits and Insurance groups both saw significant growth, with particularly notable performance in advisory services. While the payroll business experienced some softness, this was offset by continued revenue growth in other service lines within the group.

Same unit revenue grew by 8.3% in the third quarter compared to last year, resulting in a 14.5% increase in total revenue for the nine months ended September 30. The acquisition of Shea Labagh Dobberstein in early September further bolstered the company's revenue prospects.

Despite headwinds related to higher expenses compared to last year, CBIZ expects strong full-year revenue growth of 12% to 15%. Adjusted earnings per share growth is projected to be within a range of 20% to 24%. The company's strong cash flow and unused credit capacity will allow it to continue pursuing strategic acquisitions and share repurchases, contributing to its future growth.
