Westwood Financial has closed its Westwood International Advisors operation in Toronto, with most of its cash repatriated to the United States, improving financial flexibility. Despite challenging market conditions, equity markets have rebounded, exhibiting divergence in performance between indices, with mega caps and growth sectors outperforming. Westwood's U.S. equity value products have mixed performances, with LargeCap and LargeCap select underperforming due to the rally in lower-quality stocks. SMid cap and SmallCap strategies have outperformed, with SMid cap particularly strong. The multi-asset group has benefited from crosscurrents, finding mispriced securities and managing risk. High income and global convertibles have performed well. Westwood's wealth management business continues to grow, with client assets remaining stable. New business inflows are expected from client referrals and estate planning discussions. In institutional and intermediary sales, there have been inflows into SmallCap and income opportunity strategies. Outflows were primarily due to closures and client rebalancing. The third quarter was impacted by several one-time items resulting in a net loss of $10.3 million. Firmwide assets under management totaled $12 billion, with solid financial strength evidenced by cash and short-term investments of $77.6 million and a debt-free balance sheet.
