Despite the challenges of 2020, Macerich made a strong recovery by reopening all its properties, improving rent collections to 92%, and cautiously optimistic about 2021. The company expects occupancy to increase in the second half of this year and anticipates strong double-digit growth for the same-center NOI. They have extended four secured mortgage loans totaling over $660 million and estimate $60-$75 million in collections related to 2020 billed rents. Macerich plans to reduce debt and fund its development pipeline with cash flow from operations. They have already leased 60% of expiring square footage, with the remaining 40% in the letter of intent stage. Notable lease signings include Dior, Louis Vuitton, Primark, Dave & Buster's, and ModelLand. Macerich is also exploring alternative uses for their properties to meet the evolving needs of their modern-day shoppers, creating a diverse and vibrant town center environment.
