Martin Marietta delivered record-breaking results in the third quarter, driven by strong demand in all primary end markets. Organic shipment and pricing growth contributed to record-setting revenues and gross profit, despite elevated energy costs. Acquisitions, particularly the recent Lehigh Hanson West Region purchase, further fueled growth. Cement shipments and pricing saw notable gains, while ready-mixed concrete and asphalt shipments also increased. Magnesia Specialties remained strong, benefitting from improved domestic steel production and global demand.

Management remains optimistic about the future, citing favorable market dynamics, including increased public and private construction activity in key regions. The acquisition of Lehigh West expands Martin Marietta's presence in California and Arizona, providing new growth opportunities. Despite challenges with contractor labor shortages and logistics, the company expects low to mid-single digit organic aggregate shipment growth in 2022, with mid to high single digit organic aggregates pricing growth supported by a value-over-volume pricing strategy. The company is committed to repaying debt and returning to its target leverage range within the next 18 months. Martin Marietta's industry-leading performance, disciplined execution, and strategic focus position the company for continued growth and stakeholder value creation in the years to come.
