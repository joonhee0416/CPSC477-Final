TDS Telecom and US Cellular reported mixed results for the third quarter, highlighting the impact of a competitive operating environment and ongoing strategic investments. US Cellular's revenue declined slightly year-over-year due to promotional activity and a decrease in equipment sales. However, the company saw growth in postpaid subscribers and average revenue per user. TDS Telecom's revenue grew slightly, driven by increased broadband subscribers and higher average residential revenue. The company continues to expand its fiber footprint, with a specific focus on underserved areas. Both US Cellular and TDS Telecom are facing challenges with supply chain constraints and permitting delays, which are impacting construction timelines and equipment availability. The companies remain committed to growth and are optimizing their approach to balance subscriber gains and profitability. TDS Telecom has increased its fiber deployment and is expecting to grow significantly over the next several years. Despite the competitive landscape and operational challenges, both companies are maintaining their financial targets for the year.
