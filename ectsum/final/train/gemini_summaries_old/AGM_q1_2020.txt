Farmer Mac, created during the 1980s crisis to support financial institutions serving rural America, reported a strong start to 2020. Despite challenges in March due to COVID-19, they continued operations uninterrupted. Farmer Mac's financial fundamentals, including a $20.1 million core earnings and an allowance for losses consistent with industry peers, remain strong. The company's access to capital markets, with $2.5 billion in medium-term note issuances, and liquidity position of over $1 billion, significantly exceeds regulatory requirements and allows for ample flexibility.

Farmer Mac has proactively supported customers during the pandemic, offering loan closing flexibility, competitive pricing, and payment deferment options for borrowers. They have also invested in infrastructure, launching a new customer portal platform and an enhanced loan origination platform for increased efficiency.

While COVID-19 has impacted the agricultural sector, Farmer Mac's credit portfolio remains healthy. Delinquencies in the Farm & Ranch portfolio have increased slightly, but remain well within historical averages. The company's focus on risk management and diversification has mitigated potential losses.

Farmer Mac remains committed to its mission of providing credit and liquidity to rural America, leveraging its strong balance sheet and capital markets access to navigate these uncertain times. Their ongoing investment in technology and business infrastructure will ensure they can continue to meet customer needs effectively.
