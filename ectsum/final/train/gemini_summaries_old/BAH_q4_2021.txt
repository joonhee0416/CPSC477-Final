Booz Allen has exceeded its three-year financial objectives set in 2018, driven by strong organic revenue growth, EBITDA margin expansion, and robust capital deployment. The company's adjusted diluted earnings per share nearly doubled to $3.90 in fiscal year 2021. Despite pandemic-related challenges, Booz Allen delivered strong organic revenue growth of 7.1% for the full-year, excluding billable expenses. The defense and civil businesses led growth, while intelligence and global commercial are undergoing portfolio reshaping. Backlog grew 16% to a record $24 billion, indicating continued robust demand for its services. Booz Allen expects low-single-digit revenue growth in the first half of fiscal 2022, accelerating significantly in the second half. The company anticipates full-year revenue growth of 7-10%, driven by organic growth and the Liberty IT acquisition. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to remain in the mid-10% range, with adjusted diluted earnings per share projected between $4.10 and $4.30. Booz Allen remains focused on accelerating recruiting, reshaping intelligence and commercial portfolios, and investing in advanced capabilities for future growth.
