Rollins witnessed a strong financial performance in 2020, marked by a 7.2% revenue increase to $2.161 billion and a 28.3% net income increase to $260.8 million. In Q4, revenue increased by 6% to $536.3 million, driven by 11% growth in residential pest control and 8.7% in termite and ancillary services. The company's commitment to sustainability and social responsibility was emphasized, with the launch of a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion initiative and ongoing efforts in Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG). Rollins continues to focus on cost containment and efficiency improvements, resulting in a 50.3% gross margin, offset by higher materials and PPE expenses. The company expanded its global presence through strategic acquisitions and remains confident in its future growth, citing the increasing need for mosquito control services and the strong balance sheet. The Board of Directors approved a 50% increase in the regular cash dividend, payable on March 10, 2021.
