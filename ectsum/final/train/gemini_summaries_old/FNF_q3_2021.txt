FNF delivered a record-breaking third quarter with 31% revenue growth to $3.9 billion, resulting in a 39% surge in adjusted net earnings to $604 million. The Title business continued to excel, setting new performance records with a 21.7% adjusted pre-tax margin, driven by strong demand for commercial and purchase transactions. Notably, the company has expanded into new distribution channels and accelerated sales growth, leading to a 9% increase in assets under management.

F&G achieved significant milestones, expanding into new institutional channels and issuing funding agreement-backed notes. The company saw a 43% increase in retail annuity sales and closed $371 million in pension risk transfer transactions, positioning it well for future growth. F&G's total assets under management reached $32.7 billion, driven by $2.3 billion of net new business flows.

The company raised $450 million in senior notes and funded a $400 million intercompany loan to F&G. Holding company cash balance grew to $1.5 billion despite ongoing share buybacks and quarterly dividends. FNF repurchased 1.3 million shares during the quarter, reaching its $500 million share buyback target announced in October 2020. The company also increased its quarterly cash dividend by 10%.

Looking ahead, FNF expects continued growth in its Title business despite a potential decline in refinance activity. F&G is on track to double its annual sales in 2021 and is projected to double its assets and earnings within five years. FNF remains committed to a prudent capital allocation strategy, prioritizing shareholder returns and strategic investments in its businesses.
