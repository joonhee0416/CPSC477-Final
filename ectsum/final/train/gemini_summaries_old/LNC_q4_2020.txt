Lincoln Financial Group reported $1.78 per share in adjusted operating earnings for Q4, impacted by elevated pandemic-related claims. The company's underlying earnings remain intact, and it expects to deliver 8-10% earnings per share growth in the long term. Lincoln focused on repricing its products, achieving cost savings, and maintaining a strong balance sheet in 2020. In annuities, the company expanded its shelf space and doubled the number of producers selling its indexed variable annuity products. Retirement plan services saw strong performance with a 6% increase in total deposits and six consecutive years of positive net flows. The life insurance business repositioned its product portfolio to leverage separate accounts as the investment engine, offering expanded choice and alternative value propositions for consumers. Group protection experienced stability, with persistency up and premium growth improving. Investment results were strong, with an 11% annual return in the alternative investment portfolio. Despite pandemic headwinds, Lincoln's strong balance sheet, expense management capabilities, and robust capital deployment plans position the company for growth in 2021 and beyond.
