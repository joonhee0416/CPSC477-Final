Church & Dwight's Q2 exceeded expectations, with adjusted EPS of $0.76 driven by strong organic sales growth of 4.5%, despite supply challenges and inflation. The company experienced consumption growth in 13 of 16 categories, with notable gains in gummy vitamins, stain fighters, cat litter, and dental care products. Online sales remained elevated at 14.2% of total sales.

However, supply issues persisted, constraining shipments and affecting market share for some brands. The company announced additional price increases on 50% of its portfolio to mitigate inflation, which is expected to impact full-year gross margin by 75 basis points. Despite these challenges, the company remains optimistic about its long-term performance and is forecasting full-year reported sales growth of 5% and organic sales growth of 4%.
