Benchmark achieved revenue of $521 million in Q4, with improved gross margins of 9.6%. Despite higher SG&A expenses, the company's non-GAAP operating margin came in at 3.4%, resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.34. Benchmark's efforts to reduce inventory and improve working capital resulted in a 71-day cash conversion cycle, generating $84 million in free cash flow for the quarter.

Through 2020, Benchmark made progress on strategic initiatives such as customer satisfaction enhancements and reducing regrettable losses. These achievements contributed to over $800 million in new bookings, driven by wins in the medical, A&D, industrial, and computing sectors. Notably, a flight control system win involved a collaborative solution that included differentiated product engineering and robust global manufacturing.

For the full year 2020, Benchmark faced challenges from the pandemic, resulting in a revenue decline to $2.1 billion. However, higher-value markets saw growth, with semi-cap and medical sectors increasing by 33% and 11%, respectively. Despite the challenges, cash conversion cycle days improved, with the company generating $120 million in cash flow from operations.

Looking ahead to 2021, Benchmark expects revenue to range from $480 million to $520 million in Q1, influenced by normal seasonality. Gross margins are projected to be 8.1% to 8.3%, with SG&A expenses between $29 million and $31 million. The company anticipates mid-single-digit revenue growth for the full year, supported by growth in medical, semi-cap, industrial, and high-performance computing sectors. Benchmark is committed to improving margins and SG&A efficiency while continuing to invest in sustainability and diversity and inclusion initiatives.
