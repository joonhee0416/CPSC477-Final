Master Planned Communities (MPCs), which generate income through land sales, saw significant growth, with increased sales and land prices. New home sales, a key indicator of future land demand, also surged by 23%.

Commercial assets, including retail, hospitality, and the Las Vegas Ballpark, reported strong year-over-year and sequential NOI growth. Notably, retail properties in Downtown Summerlin surpassed pre-pandemic activity levels.

Condo sales in Hawaii's Ward Village remained robust, with elevated demand despite travel restrictions. The three towers under construction are nearly sold out.

The Seaport in New York City experienced notable improvements, with increased foot traffic driven by events, restaurant activity, and retail growth.

Overall, the company reported a net income of $4.8 million, up from a loss in the prior year period, due to the strong results across its segments. Management remains confident in achieving its previously disclosed guidance targets for the year.
