Despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, Thermon's Q2 performance showed sequential improvement in revenue, gross margins, and cost reductions. Revenue reached $66.4 million, up 17% from Q1 but down 35% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 661% to $10.5 million due to volume improvements and cost reduction initiatives. The team's efforts, including SG&A and manufacturing overhead reductions, have positioned the business to deliver EBITDA margin expansion during the downturn and leverage opportunities as end markets recover. Thermon's book-to-bill ratio of 1.14 was positive for the third consecutive quarter, and backlog improved by 8% sequentially and 16% year-over-year, with margins increasing by 420 basis points due to a favorable mix of business. While capital spending is expected to remain weak in the second half of the year, Thermon anticipates a moderation in revenue shortfalls and meaningful impact from cost reductions on bottom line performance. The company remains focused on managing costs, cash flow, and investing in future growth to emerge from the pandemic as a stronger and more profitable entity.
