MDU Resources reported earnings of $100.2 million or $0.50 per share for the second quarter of 2021, matching the prior year's results.

Notably, Construction Services Group reported record earnings and backlog, while the construction materials business maintained near-record levels. MDU Resources is optimistic about infrastructure funding opportunities and has affirmed its earnings per share guidance of $2.00 to $2.15 for 2021. The company's strong balance sheet, credit ratings, and consistent dividend history further support its continued growth and shareholder value creation.
