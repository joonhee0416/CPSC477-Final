In Q4 2021, Oil States generated $161 million in revenue and $13.4 million in adjusted consolidated EBITDA, despite challenges from the pandemic and supply chain disruptions. The Offshore/Manufactured Products segment saw a 34% revenue increase, driven by project and service revenue growth. Backlog reached $260 million, the highest since Q1 2020. The Well Site Services segment's revenue was $43 million, with a 14% adjusted EBITDA margin. The Downhole Technologies segment's revenue was $26 million, with increased sales of perforating products in the U.S. being offset by declines in international sales. For 2022, Oil States expects consolidated revenue to grow by 20% or more, with EBITDA ranging from $60 million to $70 million. The outlook is positive due to reduced COVID-19 disruptions, lower global oil inventories, and improving demand across segments.
