Haverty Furniture Companies reported solid Q3 results with a record $260.4 million in sales and a 19.7% increase in delivered sales. The company's gross margins rose to 56.8% due to improved pricing, but were partially offset by increased LIFO reserves. Despite significant supply chain challenges, including a Vietnam factory shutdown and port congestion, Haverty's inventory position has improved, with a rise of 8% in warehouse inventory. Sales momentum remains strong, as evidenced by record delivery weeks. Haverty's is expanding into new stores and investing in distribution and technology to improve efficiency and customer service. The company expects to continue its strong performance in Q4, with improvements in shipping times and lead times. Despite rising costs, Haverty's remains optimistic about its long-term growth prospects due to the increasing importance of home furnishings in a post-COVID world.
