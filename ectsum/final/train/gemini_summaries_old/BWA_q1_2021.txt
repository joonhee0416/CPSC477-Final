BorgWarner began 2021 with an 18% organic revenue increase, well above market growth. This translates to an impressive 570 basis point outgrowth, driven by strong performance in North America and Europe. The company's adjusted operating margin also improved to 11.1%, with an incremental margin of 25%, excluding foreign exchange. Despite ongoing supply chain issues, BorgWarner generated $147 million in free cash flow. Looking forward, the company has revised its full-year guidance to reflect a more conservative industry production outlook. Revenue is now projected to be between $14.8 billion and $15.4 billion, an increase from the previous guidance. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to fall between $4 and $4.35. Notably, BorgWarner has announced plans to acquire AKASOL, a leading manufacturer of lithium-ion battery systems for electric vehicles. This acquisition aligns with the company's long-term strategy, "Project Charging Forward," which aims to achieve 25% of revenue from electric vehicles by 2025. Additionally, BorgWarner has secured a significant program win for its Integrated Drive Module (IDM) in an electric vehicle from a major non-Chinese OEM. The IDM combines BorgWarner's electric motor, transmission, and power electronics, offering exceptional power density and functionality. These advancements underscore the company's commitment to electric vehicle technology and its position as a leader in the industry.
