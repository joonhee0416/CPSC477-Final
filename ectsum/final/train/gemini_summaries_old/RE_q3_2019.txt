Everest Insurance Group reported strong third-quarter results, with $3.39 per share in operating earnings despite $280 million in catastrophe losses. The underlying performance remains solid, as the attritional underwriting gain of $250 million nearly offset the cat loss. On a year-to-date basis, the underwriting profit was $365 million and $700 million, excluding cats. This outcome demonstrates the company's ability to absorb cat volatility due to its large and diversified book of business. When combined with another solid quarter of investment income, the year-to-date operating income is at $742 million.

The Reinsurance division saw growth in mortgage risk and casualty lines, where rates, terms, and conditions have been improving. The push into casualty lines has been recent, as the market has been improving and the company has been growing premium. The greatest diversification has been the successful push into specialty insurance. By year-end, the annual gross premium will close in on $3 billion.

The company's timing on these initiatives has been favorable, as rates are improving in many sectors. While there have been pockets of frequency and severity trends, these are managed through conservative loss picks through the cycle. The market is poised to continue higher due to trend, increasing weather events, and anemic investment returns on new money, providing opportunities for Everest in the coming year.
