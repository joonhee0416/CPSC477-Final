Sensient Technologies reported a 4% increase in consolidated adjusted local currency revenue for Q1, primarily driven by strong performances in Flavors & Extracts (9% growth) and Asia Pacific (5% growth). The Flavors & Extracts Group saw a 21% adjusted local currency operating profit growth due to strong sales and a focus on value-added products, while the Asia Pacific Group achieved over 30% adjusted local currency operating profit growth. The Color Group faced challenges in personal care due to COVID-19, resulting in a 13% decline in adjusted local currency operating profit. Despite these headwinds, the company is optimistic about the year, citing an increase in new sampling requests and a solid sales pipeline. Furthermore, it has completed the sale of its Fragrances business and is exploring potential acquisition opportunities in its core product lines. Overall, Sensient Technologies remains confident in delivering mid-single-digit revenue growth and operating profit margin improvement over the long term in Flavors & Extracts and Asia Pacific, with expectations of improvement in the Color Group as COVID-19 impacts subside.
