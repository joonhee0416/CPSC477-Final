Cummins reported strong Q2 results with revenue increasing 59% YoY to $6.1 billion, exceeding expectations. Demand remains elevated, leading to robust sales growth across most businesses and regions. Despite industry supply chain constraints resulting in higher freight and labor costs, profitability remained solid. Notably, Cummins secured strategic partnerships with Iberdrola, Sinopec, and Chevron to accelerate the deployment of hydrogen and alternative energy solutions. The company also announced the exploration of strategic alternatives for its Filtration business, including potential separation into a standalone company. Cummins maintains its full-year guidance of 20-24% revenue growth and 15.5-16% EBITDA margin, driven by ongoing demand strength, investments in new technologies, and partnerships. The company anticipates continued supply chain disruptions but expects improvements in truck production in North America and aims to return 75% of operating cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
