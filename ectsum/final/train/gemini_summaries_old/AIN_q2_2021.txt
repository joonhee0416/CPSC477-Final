Albany International reported a strong second quarter with revenue growth and near-record profitability. The company delivered $235 million in revenue, driven by growth in Engineered Composites and Machine Clothing segments. Gross margins declined slightly due to supply chain challenges, material cost inflation, and logistics issues. However, the company offset these impacts and achieved adjusted earnings per share of $1.10. Albany continues to invest in research and technology development, particularly in 3D-woven composites and automated fiber placement composite wing skins. Despite facing supply chain challenges, the company expects to benefit from recovering domestic airline travel and strong demand for packaging, tissue, and engineered materials. Albany remains cautious about the potential impact of the delta variant but is optimistic about long-term growth opportunities. The company raised its guidance for the full year, now expecting revenue between $880 million and $910 million, adjusted earnings per share between $2.90 and $3.20, and adjusted EBITDA between $225 million and $240 million.
