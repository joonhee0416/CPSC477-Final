Vector Group reported solid financial results for the third quarter of 2020. Revenues increased to $547.8 million, driven by growth in both the tobacco and real estate segments. Net income attributed to Vector Group rose to $38.1 million, or $0.25 per diluted common share, while adjusted EBITDA increased to $103.3 million. The company maintained a strong liquidity position with cash and cash equivalents of $451 million. The tobacco business continued to perform well, with Liggett reporting a 25% increase in tobacco adjusted operating income. Eagle 20's volume grew by approximately 2% despite increased net pricing, and the expansion of the Montego brand is showing promise. Douglas Elliman's revenue improved in the third quarter compared to the second quarter but still faced challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The company implemented expense reduction initiatives, resulting in lower operating and administrative expenses. Despite the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on the real estate market, fourth quarter cash receipts have strengthened. Vector Group remains focused on generating incremental operating income from both Pyramid and Eagle 20's, and the company's strong cash reserves and consistent increase in tobacco unit volume and profits position it well for the future. The company expects to continue its quarterly cash dividend policy.
