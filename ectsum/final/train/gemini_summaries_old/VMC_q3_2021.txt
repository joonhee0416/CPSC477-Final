In Q3 2021, Vulcan Materials reported a 4% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $418 million despite challenges such as energy inflation and labor constraints. The company's aggregates segment drove growth, achieving a 3% increase in aggregate cash gross profit per ton and a 5% same-store volume increase. This was driven by improved demand, consistent execution of strategic disciplines, and disciplined cost control. The Asphalt segment faced headwinds due to higher energy and liquid asphalt costs, while the Concrete segment saw increased gross profit due to the acquisition of U.S. Concrete. Looking ahead, Vulcan expects continued pricing momentum, with early price increases and sequential quarterly growth. The demand picture remains positive, with improvement in major end markets and the potential impact of the bipartisan infrastructure bill. The company's strategic focus includes organic growth, M&A, and greenfield developments, with a focus on disciplined capital allocation and financial flexibility. Overall, Vulcan's strong performance and momentum set it up well for 2022, with projected price increases of at least 5% and optimization of synergies from the U.S. Concrete acquisition.
