EnPro Industries reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results, with adjusted EBITDA exceeding expectations by 11% to $48.1 million on a 17.4% margin. The company's portfolio reshaping strategy, including the acquisition of Alluxa, divestitures of low-margin businesses, and cost-cutting initiatives, contributed to the improved performance. EnPro saw strong demand in the semiconductor, food and pharma, automotive, and heavy-duty truck markets, offsetting weakness in oil and gas, general industrial, and aerospace. Key acquisitions, such as LeanTeq and Alluxa, have expanded EnPro's reach into high-growth markets and contributed to the company's solid order intake and backlog. EnPro's focus on operational excellence through its Capability Center has driven margin expansion. The company anticipates a strong first quarter due to Alluxa's order momentum and backlog. For 2021, EnPro forecasts 6-10% sales growth and adjusted EBITDA of $178-$188 million, with a slightly higher distribution of earnings in the latter half of the year.
