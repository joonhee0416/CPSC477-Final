In a tumultuous 2020, Macerich faced closures and missed rent payments due to COVID-19, leading to significant liquidity conservation measures. However, the company persevered, with rent collections rising from 35% in April/May to 80% in Q3 and 92% in Q4, now trending above 90% in January. Despite a 4.3% drop in occupancy to 89.7% from December 2019, the company expects to recover occupancy in the second half of 2021, with double-digit same-center NOI growth projected for the latter half of the year. Macerich's focus on negotiating workout agreements, expanding its pipeline, and attracting alternative uses to its properties positions it for a transitional 2021 and a brighter future beyond COVID-19.
