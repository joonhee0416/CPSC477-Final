Simon Property Group's business is thriving, with a significant increase in profitability and cash flow. Second-quarter funds from operations were $1.22 billion, or $3.24 per share. International operations were impacted by government restrictions, resulting in a loss of $0.06 per share. Despite this, overall domestic-international property NOI increased 16.6% year-over-year. Leasing activity accelerated, with nearly 1,400 leases signed for 5.2 million square feet, and average base minimum rent increased to $50.03. Retail sales continued to rise, reaching June 2019 levels and up 80% compared to last year. The company's retail investments, including SPARC Group and JCPenney, outperformed expectations. In addition, Simon Property Group has a strong financial position with $8.8 billion in liquidity and a low dividend payout ratio. Given these positive results, the company has increased its full-year 2021 FFO guidance range to $10.70 to $10.80 per share, representing a 17% to 19% growth compared to 2020.
