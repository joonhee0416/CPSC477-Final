CF's 2020 earnings reflected a challenging year, with lower global nitrogen prices offset by higher volumes and reduced costs. The company achieved record safety, production, and sales levels, despite the pandemic. Looking ahead, the outlook for nitrogen pricing is optimistic, with strong demand driven by high crop prices and a steeper global cost curve. The recent weather disruptions in the Southern Plains and Midwest have further tightened supply, supporting the positive 2021 outlook. CF anticipates capital expenditures of $450 million, a return to normal maintenance levels, and the initiation of expenses for the Green ammonia project. Despite expected higher natural gas costs, improved margins are projected due to higher realized urea prices. Long-term, CF remains focused on its clean energy growth strategy, leveraging its unique capabilities to provide clean and low-carbon ammonia for decarbonization efforts.
