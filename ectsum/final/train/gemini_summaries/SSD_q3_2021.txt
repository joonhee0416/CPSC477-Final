Simpson reported a strong third quarter with net sales increasing by 8.9% to $396.7 million, primarily driven by price increases implemented to offset escalating raw material costs. Despite challenges in the home center channel, Simpson's gross margin expanded to 49.9% due to these price increases. The company's income from operations improved to $100.6 million, resulting in earnings per diluted share of $1.70.

Moving forward, Simpson anticipates continued raw material cost pressure, leading to an expected 400-500 basis points decline in operating margin for 2022. However, the company remains focused on its key growth initiatives in the OEM, repair/remodel, DIY, mass timber, concrete construction, and structural steel markets. Simpson's strong financial position, including $294.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, supports its growth and stockholder return priorities. The company expects to remain active in share repurchasing and has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share. Simpson remains confident in its ability to maintain industry-leading operating margins in the long term, despite near-term economic headwinds.
