ESCO continues to navigate COVID-19 challenges, with Q3 performance boosted by portfolio diversification, solid contributions from operating units, and cost reductions. The Aerospace & Defense (A&D) segment witnessed order activity increase by over 40% year-over-year in Q3, driven by military, aerospace, navy, and space end markets. The USG segment outperformed with adjusted EBIT margins improving to 19.4% from 15.1% last year. Despite softness in sales from commercial aerospace and utility businesses, ESCO remains optimistic about long-term market outlook and is actively managing material inflation and transportation issues. The company closed two acquisitions in July and August, Altanova and Phenix Technologie, to enhance product offerings and global footprint. Free cash flow conversion reached 118% of net earnings in the first nine months. ESCO has provided a Q4 guidance range of $0.73 to $0.78 per share, based on sales levels between $190 million and $200 million, excluding the impact of recent acquisitions.
