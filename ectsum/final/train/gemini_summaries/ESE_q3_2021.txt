Despite ongoing COVID-19 challenges, ESCO Technologies saw a strong Q3 performance with sales growth in all three segments (A&D, USG, and Test). A&D improved thanks to increased orders and recovery in Navy and space businesses, despite a decline in commercial aerospace sales. USG outperformed with profitability improvements driven by cost reductions, while Test remained steady. Notably, two acquisitions (Altanova and Phenix Technologies) are expected to enhance product offerings and global footprint for the USG segment. ESCO's cash generation and balance sheet remain strong, supported by working capital initiatives and cost optimization efforts. The company's diverse portfolio and market exposure provide growth opportunities, particularly in military, aerospace, and renewable energy. However, Q4 sales outlook is slightly below projections due to adjustments in the commercial aerospace and utility businesses.
