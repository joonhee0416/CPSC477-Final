Donaldson's third quarter witnessed record sales, driven by a significant 22% year-over-year increase, and the company has raised its fiscal 2021 guidance. Off-Road sales surged by 26%, primarily due to strong demand in construction, agriculture, and mining. On-Road sales surged 58% over 2020, with heavy-duty truck order and build rates projecting a steady outlook for the upcoming quarters. Aftermarket sales increased by 23%, supported by increased utilization rates of equipment. Industrial Filtration Solutions experienced an uptick in sales as businesses transitioned from "fix it" to "replace it" cycles. Earnings per share grew by 32%, and gross margin improved by 50 basis points. The company's momentum is likely to carry into the first half of fiscal 2022, and it expects full-year sales to rise by 9 to 11%. Challenges in the supply chain are expected to continue through Q4 2021, but Donaldson is implementing pricing actions to mitigate the impact on margins. The company remains committed to investing in its Advance and Accelerate portfolio, pursuing acquisitions, particularly in life sciences, and maintaining control over operating expenses.
