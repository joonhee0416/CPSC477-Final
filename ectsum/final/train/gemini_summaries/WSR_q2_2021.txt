Whitestone REIT had a strong second quarter, driven by increased demand for its shopping centers in high-growth Sunbelt markets. Occupancy reached 89.9%, fueled by 15-20 new tenants representing a 1% increase per quarter. This demand stems from a combination of attractive locations, tenant expansions, and population migration. The company's diversified tenant base of over 1400 businesses has a notable impact on its balance sheet, with no single tenant impacting revenues by more than 2.9%. The company's leasing strategy has yielded positive spreads of 6.8% on new and renewal leases, and it benefits from annual lease increases of 2-3% and pass-through expenses. Whitestone's focus on acquiring and developing properties with significant upside potential has increased its asset base and added to its profitability. Its debt-to-EBITDA ratio has improved to 8.2, and it has continued to reduce its G&A expenses as a percentage of revenue. The company's dividend remains well-funded, with a payout ratio of 41% of FFO Core. Whitestone's long-term value creation strategy involves increasing occupancy, revenue, and cash flow, which it believes is not yet fully reflected in its valuation.
