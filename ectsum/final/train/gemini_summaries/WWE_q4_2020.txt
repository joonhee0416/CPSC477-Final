WWE highlighted its financial performance in a challenging environment, reporting record revenue and profit for the year. A key development is its strategic partnership with NBCUniversal's Peacock streaming service, which will host WWE Network content starting March 18. This deal provides greater value to subscribers and expands WWE's reach to over 33 million Peacock users. Despite the ongoing impact of COVID-19, WWE remained committed to producing content, transitioning its flagship programs to the ThunderDome and later Tropicana Field for live virtual fan experiences. The company anticipates a gradual return to ticketed live events but estimates a revenue loss of over $90 million due to the pandemic. However, TV production costs will increase with the ThunderDome's continued use and the return of furloughed employees. WWE projects adjusted OIBDA for 2021 between $270 million and $305 million, with revenue growth offset by increasing expenses. The company also emphasized its financial outlook in a post-COVID world, noting that TV production costs may decline but will likely remain higher than pre-pandemic levels due to schedule adjustments. Despite the challenges, WWE believes it is well-positioned for long-term success and will continue to innovate across all business lines.
