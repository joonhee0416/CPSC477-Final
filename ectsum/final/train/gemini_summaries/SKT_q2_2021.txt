Tanger Outlets' Q2 results demonstrate solid progress in driving profitability and shareholder value. Occupancy has improved by 130 basis points to 93%, same-center NOI has increased by 88% compared to Q2 2020, and tenant sales have outpaced pre-pandemic levels. Leasing activity remains strong, with over 300 new leases and renewals totaling 1.6 million square feet commenced in the last 12 months. Tanger has prudently allocated capital, reducing debt and strengthening its balance sheet through opportunistic ATM share sales and early debt redemption. The company's financial guidance for 2021 reflects continued improvement in business performance, despite additional dilution from common share issuances. Occupancy is projected to improve further, with potential recapture of an additional 65,000 square feet.
