RLI's third quarter brought a 9% top line growth, achieving a 99.5 combined ratio despite the impact of severe hurricanes. Net earnings drove book value per share up 13% for the year. Pricing momentum continued across multiple products, particularly in excess liability and automobile exposures, resulting in double-digit revenue growth. The quarter's underwriting loss in the property segment was attributed to four named storms, including Hurricane Laura. However, the company experienced a 75 combined ratio in the surety segment and maintained profitability in all major segments. Despite headwinds, RLI reported strong operating cash flow and favorable results from investee earnings. The company remains focused on disciplined underwriting, customer service, and investing in technology to enhance customer experience.
