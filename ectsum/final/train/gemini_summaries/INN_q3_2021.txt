Summit Hotel Properties experienced strong operating results in Q3, surpassing expectations with a 25% increase in RevPAR from Q2. Occupancy, average daily rate, and profitability reached post-pandemic highs, leading to a threefold increase in positive corporate cash flow. Leisure demand fueled growth, with a 7% increase in room nights sold compared to Q2. Corporate transient demand also showed signs of recovery, with negotiated room revenue increasing by 28%. Pro forma RevPAR reached $98, double the same period last year, though still 24% lower than Q3 2019. Average rates increased by 19%, driven by higher weekday rates. Notably, the acquisition of a 110-room residence in Steamboat Springs generated strong occupancy and RevPAR. The company also acquired a 27-hotel portfolio from NewcrestImage, comprising 3,700 rooms in Sunbelt markets. This transaction, valued at $822 million, will increase Summit's room count by over 30% and is expected to be earnings-accretive. The joint venture with GIC will fund the acquisition with a $410 million credit facility, while preserving Summit's liquidity.
