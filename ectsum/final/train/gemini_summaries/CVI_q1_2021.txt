CVR Partners faced challenges in Q1 2021, reporting a net loss of $55 million and a loss per share of $0.39. Unplanned downtime and increased operating costs due to the winter storm negatively impacted results by $41 million, while a noncash mark-to-market on the 2020 RIN obligation contributed an additional $98 million loss. Despite these obstacles, throughput increased from 157,000 bpd in Q1 2020 to 186,000 bpd in Q1 2021. Elevated RIN prices continued to consume much of the increase in crack spreads. The Petroleum segment experienced negative EBITDA of $61 million, primarily due to RINs expenses and derivative losses. In contrast, the Fertilizer segment reported an operating loss of $14 million, driven by lower sales volumes and prices. Despite these challenges, CVR Partners remains optimistic, with positive EBITDA trends observed in March. Looking ahead to Q2 2021, the company estimates higher throughput and capital spending, while the Fertilizer segment anticipates increased ammonia utilization rates and strong demand due to higher crop prices.
