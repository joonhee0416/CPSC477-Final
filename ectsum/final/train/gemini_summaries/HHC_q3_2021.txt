Howard Hughes Corporation (HHC) reported strong results across all segments in Q3 2021, surpassing pre-COVID activity levels recorded in 2019. Notably, the company raised its 2021 MPC EBT guidance by $60 million, citing higher-than-anticipated superpad sales in Summerlin. HHC is also strategically redeploying net proceeds from noncore asset sales to acquire a fully entitled shovel-ready MPC in Phoenix West Valley, Arizona. This acquisition adds to the company's depth of opportunities and is expected to transform the area into a leading community focused on sustainability and technology. Additionally, HHC announced a $250 million share buyback program to enhance shareholder value, given the significant discount at which the stock is trading relative to its net asset value.
