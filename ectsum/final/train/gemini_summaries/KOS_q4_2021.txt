Kosmos achieved a year of operational momentum and strategic progress in 2021. With production targets met, reserves strengthened, and the Oxy Ghana and Tortue FPSO transactions completed, Kosmos has positioned itself for growth. The company's 50% production growth projection between 2022 and 2024 is driven by Tortue phase one, Jubilee Southeast, and Winterfell developments. Simultaneously, Kosmos anticipates materially increased cash flow generation, aided by rising EBITDAX and a decrease in unit costs. By year-end 2022, the company targets a leverage ratio of 1.5 times, supported by a combination of absolute debt reduction and rising EBITDAX. Kosmos' sustainable cash flow generation, underpinned by a 20-year 2P reserve life, positions the company to deliver shareholder returns once leverage falls below target. The Tortue project, expected to deliver first gas in late 2023, is a key component of Kosmos' gas growth strategy, along with plans to commercialize additional gas resources in Mauritania and Senegal.
