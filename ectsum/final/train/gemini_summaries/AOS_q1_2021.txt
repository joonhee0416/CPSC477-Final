A.O. Smith's first quarter earnings per share reached $0.60, a 21% increase in sales despite challenges like supply chain disruptions and rising material costs. North America water treatment and boiler sales grew significantly, while commercial water heater volumes declined due to pandemic-related disruptions. Strong demand in China contributed to a 100% increase in sales, driven by a favorable comparison and recovering consumer demand. The company's operations faced challenges due to supply chain constraints, particularly in its water heater business, but they expect to catch up in the second and third quarters. Despite these challenges, A.O. Smith projects revenue growth of 14-15% in 2021, primarily driven by strong sales in water treatment, boilers, and China, along with price increases. The company also plans to invest in automation, innovation, and new products while returning cash to shareholders.
