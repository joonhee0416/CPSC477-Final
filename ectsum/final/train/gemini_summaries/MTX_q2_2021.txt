MTI delivered a strong second quarter with record earnings per share of $1.29, driven by robust demand across markets and operational efficiency. Performance Materials led growth with foundry, personal care, and project activities performing well. Specialty Minerals saw sales growth in all product lines, benefiting from paper demand recovery and construction strength. The Refractory segment also had an impressive quarter, fueled by increased steel utilization rates and new contract wins. MTI's acquisition of Normerica strengthens its Pet Care business, leveraging synergies and complementing its existing portfolio. Despite ongoing inflationary cost pressures, the company expects a solid third quarter, with demand remaining strong and pricing actions offsetting higher costs. MTI's cash flow generation remains robust, with free cash flow expected to be around $150 million for the full year. The company continues to prioritize sustainability, enhancing its ESG initiatives and progress toward its reduction goals.
