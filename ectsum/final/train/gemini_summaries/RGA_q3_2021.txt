RGA reported an adjusted operating loss per share of $1.11 for the quarter, primarily driven by a $5.59 per share impact from COVID-19. Despite this, the company's underlying performance was strong, as evidenced by a 9.5% growth in consolidated reported premiums and favorable experiences in its US and Canadian businesses. The company also added $140 million to in-force transactions and repurchased $46 million of shares, highlighting its balanced capital management approach. Non-COVID-19 claims were also elevated, aligned with the general population's higher mortality rates. However, the company expects COVID-19 claim costs to be manageable going forward, with vaccination rates increasing in India and South Africa. With a strong balance sheet, a diverse portfolio, and promising growth opportunities, RGA remains confident in its business and its potential for future growth.
