Roper Technologies had an impressive start to 2021, with double-digit growth in revenue, EBITDA, DEPS, and cash flow. Organic revenue growth reached 6% driven by strong recurring revenue growth and acquisitions. The Application Software segment, which represents 75% of recurring revenue, saw an impressive 44.9% EBITDA margin. Despite a decline in the Process Tech segment, improving end market conditions and continued even comps suggest double-digit organic growth for the remainder of the year. Based on this strong performance, Roper has raised its full-year adjusted DEPS guidance to $14.75-$15.00 per share and expects organic growth in the 6%-7% range. The company is also well-positioned to continue deleveraging its balance sheet and resuming capital deployment through its robust M&A pipeline.
