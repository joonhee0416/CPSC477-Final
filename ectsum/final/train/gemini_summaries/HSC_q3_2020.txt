Harsco's third-quarter results met expectations, with a 15% revenue increase in its environmental businesses, led by a surge in hazardous medical waste and double-digit growth in retail and industrial waste. Despite headwinds in its rail business, EBITDA remained consistent. Cash flow continues to be robust, exceeding 2019 levels. The ESOL acquisition integration is progressing well, with value-capture actions exceeding initial projections. The Rail business is implementing an operational recovery plan to address challenges and ensure capacity and efficiency. Looking ahead, the company expects its fourth-quarter EBITDA to range from $58 million to $63 million, with modest improvements in Clean Earth and Harsco Environmental, and free cash flow projected to reach $30 million for the full year. Despite the pandemic headwinds, Harsco remains optimistic about its end markets' recovery and is focused on executing its current programs, strengthening its balance sheet, and leveraging its strong backlog in Rail.
