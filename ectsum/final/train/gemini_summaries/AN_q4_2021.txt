In Q4, AutoNation reported strong financial results, with revenue increasing by 14% to $6.6 billion. This growth was driven by a 55% increase in used vehicle revenue and double-digit gains in customer financial services and aftersales. Despite a 20% decline in new vehicle sales due to supply chain issues, used vehicle sales grew by 21%, leading to a 130% increase in adjusted net income to $5.76 per share. The company's strong financial performance is attributed to improved margins, expense control, and the success of its AutoNation USA used car business. With over $1.5 billion in liquidity and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.5 times, AutoNation has ample capital to invest in growth opportunities. The company's management is optimistic about the future, recognizing the industry's transformation and the opportunities it presents. To drive innovation and expansion, AutoNation has created a new executive role, appointing Gianluca Camplone as EVP, head of Mobility, Business Development and Strategy, and COO of Precision Parts. The company remains committed to leveraging its brand, scale, and digital capabilities to grow its customer base and expand its mobility solutions.
