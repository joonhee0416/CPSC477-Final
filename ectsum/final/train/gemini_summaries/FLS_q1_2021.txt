Flowserve's first quarter results exceeded expectations, with adjusted earnings per share increasing over 47% year-over-year to $0.28. Bookings grew by over 16% compared to the average of the last year's final three quarters, driven by increased aftermarket and MRO activity. The company raised its full-year 2021 earnings guidance to $1.40-$1.60 per share, citing improved end market conditions and strong first quarter bookings. Flowserve projects a mid-single-digit increase in bookings for the year, primarily in aftermarket and short-cycle MRO products, resulting in a narrower revenue decline of 3%-5%. With its ongoing Flowserve 2.0 transformation program and strong balance sheet, the company is well-positioned for margin expansion and free cash flow generation as it transitions to growth. Flowserve emphasizes its strategic focus on energy transition, highlighting its capabilities in energy efficiency, carbon capture, and flow control solutions for emerging energy sources.
