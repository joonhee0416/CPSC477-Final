Live Nation anticipates a strong return to live events as vaccination rates rise and restrictions ease, especially in the U.S. and U.K. Outdoor festivals have sold out rapidly, demonstrating pent-up demand. In addition to live events, the company is expanding its global client base and enhancing its digital ticketing offerings. Live Nation is confident in its 2022 growth prospects, with double-digit increases in major tour dates and sponsorship commitments. While the second quarter is expected to show year-over-year improvement and positive AOI, Live Nation plans to reduce costs by $750 million and cash spending by $1.5 billion this year. With $2.1 billion in liquidity, the company is well-positioned to weather the remaining impact of the pandemic. Kathy Willard, CFO for 15 years, will retire in June, and Joe Berchtold will become CFO on July 1.
