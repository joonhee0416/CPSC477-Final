Trueblue faced a significant revenue decline of 39% in Q2, resulting in a net loss of $8 million or $0.23 per share due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the downturn, PeopleManagement (23% revenue decline) and PeopleReady (43% revenue decline) showed modest intra-quarter improvement. PeopleScout (53% revenue decline) was particularly affected by exposure to travel and leisure clients. Trueblue's cost management strategies have been effective, reducing expenses by 23%. The company expects gross margin contraction of 200 to 140 basis points for the year, with expenses down $90 to $100 million compared to 2019. Trueblue remains committed to health and safety, digital initiatives, and bounce-back strategies to position itself for recovery when the economy recovers.
