In Q1, the company reported strong financial results with a 7% increase in adjusted earnings per share to $1.82, driven by positive contributions from its direct cost programs, pricing above targets, and effective cost management. The number of paid worksite employees declined slightly due to one large enterprise account loss, but the company noted that it increased the number of clients by 8%. The year-end transition was successful, with worksite employees from new client sales in line with budget and attrition coming in below expectations. Gross profit increased by 7% despite the decline in worksite employees due to higher contributions from all three primary direct cost programs. Operating expenses increased by 13% but were flat when excluding performance-based compensation. The company repurchased 340,000 shares of stock, paid out $15 million in dividends, and invested $12 million in capital expenditures. The company raised its full-year guidance based on the strong first quarter results, with expected adjusted EPS of $3.83 to $4.40, up from the previous guidance of $3.27 to $4.20. This reflects an increase in expected worksite employee growth and improvements in gross profit and adjusted EBITDA.
