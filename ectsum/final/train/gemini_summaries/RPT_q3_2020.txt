The company experienced robust leasing activity, executing 106,000 square feet of new leases with a signed not open ABR of $3 million, representing a significant increase since the first quarter of 2019. The leasing pipeline remains strong with $1.5 million of ABR in lease negotiations and more in advanced LOI stages, primarily driven by grocery, off-price, QSR, and medical tenants. The company achieved double-digit growth in releasing spreads, with a 43% increase on new leases, highlighting the mark-to-market opportunity in the portfolio. The company also opened lululemon at its Woodbury Lakes property, exceeding sales expectations. Occupancy increased for anchor tenants due to deals with Nike and Burlington, while small shop leased rates were impacted by the recapture of ascena spaces. Collection rates have shown improvement, with 90% collected in October and 87% collected in Q3. The company ended the quarter with a healthy cash balance of $220 million, including $125 million of revolver borrowings and $95 million of cash. The company will continue to keep tight control over liquidity, capex, and expenses. The dividend reinstatement remains a quarterly Board decision, and guidance will not be provided due to current macro uncertainties, such as the pandemic, economic stimulus, and election results.
