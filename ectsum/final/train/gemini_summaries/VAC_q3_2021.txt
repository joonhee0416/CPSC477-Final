Marriott Vacations Worldwide (MVW), with a large portfolio of vacation ownership, exchange, and third-party management offerings, has reported strong performance this quarter. Despite Delta variant and Tahoe Basin fire impacts, occupancies remained robust in North America, with Hawaii and Orlando experiencing dips and Florida Beach resorts exceeding 2019 levels. Contract sales reached $380 million, approaching 2019 levels, with first-time buyers accounting for over 30%. The exchange and third-party management segment saw a sequential decline in active members and revenue per member, leading to a $2 million EBITDA decrease. However, margins expanded due to cost-saving initiatives. Notably, MVW paid down $500 million in corporate debt, reducing it to $2.5 billion and returning cash to shareholders through a dividend reinstatement and share repurchase program. Looking ahead, the fourth quarter is projected to see sequential growth in contract sales, with occupancies reaching pre-pandemic levels and VPGs remaining elevated.
