Medifast reported strong Q3 results, driven by growth in active earning coaches (up 44.9% YoY) and revenue per coach (up 7% YoY to a record $6,773). Revenue surged 52.3% to $413.4 million, while earnings per diluted share rose 22.3% to $3.56. The company's unique coach-based model supports new client acquisition, with new client numbers up 50% YoY in September. Despite promotional activity driving client acquisition, margins were impacted, with gross profit margin down 90 basis points to 74.3%. SG&A expenses increased 57.9% to $251.9 million due to higher commissions and increased information technology costs. Despite the expense increases, income from operations rose to $55.2 million, with the effective tax rate increasing slightly to 23.9%. The company's strong balance sheet includes $160 million of cash and equivalents and no debt. Medifast remains confident in its long-term growth prospects, targeting 15% top-line growth and a 15% operating income margin, forecasting revenue between $1.51 billion and $1.53 billion and earnings per share between $13.27 and $13.96 for fiscal 2021.
