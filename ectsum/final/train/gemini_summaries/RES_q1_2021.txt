RPC's first-quarter revenues declined to $182.6 million due to reduced activity levels and lower pricing, resulting in an operating loss of $10.5 million compared to an adjusted loss of $13.2 million last year. EBITDA dropped to $7.8 million, while the loss per share was $0.05, marginally higher than the previous quarter's adjusted loss of $0.04. Despite these challenges, encouraging trends in service lines and a reduction in oil inventory boosted optimism for industry growth. The company remained committed to capital discipline, investing approximately $55 million in maintenance and growth initiatives in 2021. Emphasizing sustainability, RPC continued to upgrade fleets to ESG-friendly dual-fuel capability, with two-thirds of its frac capacity now meeting ESG standards. While economic conditions did not support adding net capacity, the replacement of older equipment was expected to drive the transition to ESG-friendly operations in the future. The company's cash balance remained strong at $85.4 million, and it remained debt-free.
