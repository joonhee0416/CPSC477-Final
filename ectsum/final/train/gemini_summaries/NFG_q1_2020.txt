National Fuel Gas experienced solid first-quarter earnings, meeting expectations. Seneca Resources' production surged by nearly 20% year-over-year. However, due to declining natural gas prices, Seneca plans to further reduce activity levels and capital expenditures, dropping a rig this summer and deferring some completion activities. Despite this, production guidance for fiscal 2020 remains unchanged. The company raised its midpoint for gathering capital spending guidance by $10 million due to a new gathering agreement with a third-party producer. Lower E&P activity will lead to a reduction in Seneca-related gathering capital at NFG Midstream. The company's regulated businesses remain on track for growth, and its balance sheet is in good shape. Despite challenges in the natural gas market, National Fuel's diversified business model provides stability to earnings and cash flow.
