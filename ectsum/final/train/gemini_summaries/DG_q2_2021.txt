Despite a challenging operating environment and ongoing uncertainties, Dollar General reported a net sales decrease of 0.4% to $8.7 billion for the second quarter. Comp sales declined 4.7%, but still represented a 14.1% increase on a two-year stack basis. The company attributed its sales performance to increased average basket size, partially offset by a year-over-year decline in customer traffic. Notably, Dollar General expanded its health offerings with the hiring of its first Chief Medical Officer and plans to increase access to affordable healthcare products and services, particularly in rural America. Despite a decrease in gross profit margin compared to the prior year, the company remains focused on controlling expenses and capitalizing on growth opportunities. Dollar General's earnings per share for the second quarter were $2.69, reflecting a 13.8% decrease year-over-year but a strong two-year growth rate of 27.7%. The company updated its financial outlook for fiscal 2021, now expecting net sales growth of 0.5% to 1.5%, a same-store sales decline of 3.5% to 2.5%, and earnings per share in the range of $9.60 to $10.20. Dollar General remains confident in its business model and strategies to drive profitability, new store growth, and long-term shareholder value.
