Black Hills Corporation delivered strong financial results in Q3, with earnings per share rising 21% to $0.70 compared to last year. This growth was driven by new rates, increased customer growth, and usage, as well as mark-to-market gains. Despite unfavorable weather conditions, the company's net income improved quarter-over-quarter due to gross margin enhancements from new rates and riders, increased customer demand, and favorable mark-to-market gains. Black Hills maintains solid investment-grade credit ratings and a manageable debt maturity profile. The company also extended its revolving credit facility and issued notes to repay debt and enhance financial flexibility. Furthermore, the Board recently approved a 5.3% increase in the quarterly dividend, marking 51 consecutive years of dividend growth. Black Hills remains committed to a 5% to 7% average earnings growth target from 2023 to 2025 and at least 5% annual dividend growth, while maintaining a payout ratio between 50% and 60%.
