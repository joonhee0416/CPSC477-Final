AEO delivered record Q3 results with a 24% revenue growth to $1.27 billion, driven by strength across both AE and Aerie brands. Strong sales, healthy merchandise margins, and cost efficiencies led to a record operating income of $210 million, with a margin at 16.5%. Aerie continued its growth momentum, exceeding 2019 levels by over 70%. American Eagle brand achieved a profit unlock with a 27.8% operating margin, aided by inventory optimization, promotional discipline, and higher full-price sales. The company's strategic initiatives, such as Quiet Logistics acquisition, are expected to further enhance profit flow-through and improve logistics capabilities. Despite supply chain disruptions, the company managed effectively, resulting in a strong inventory position for the holiday season. However, additional freight costs in Q4 are estimated to be between $70 million to $80 million.
