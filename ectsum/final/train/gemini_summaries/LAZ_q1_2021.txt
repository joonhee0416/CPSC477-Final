In Q1 2021, Lazard reported a 15% increase in operating revenue to $645 million, fueled by growth in both Financial Advisory (8%) and Asset Management (22%). Financial Advisory benefited from strong M&A activity, with a volume of announced transactions up significantly. Asset Management reached a record $265 billion in AUM as of March 31, driven by management fees and incentive fees from fixed income and alternative strategies. The company anticipates continued growth in both businesses, with the macroeconomic environment improving and driving global strategic activity. Lazard is investing in high-growth areas such as ESG strategies, quantitative investing, and alternative and thematic strategies to meet investor demand.
