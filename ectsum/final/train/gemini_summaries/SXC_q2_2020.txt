Despite pandemic-related challenges, SunCoke maintains essential operations and is addressing lower demand by partnering with customers on near-term coke needs, resulting in extended contracts and production reduction. The company is implementing cost-cutting measures, including workforce reduction, to optimize operations, with permanent annual savings of $10 million expected starting in 2021. SunCoke is also expanding into the foundry coke market, with recent trials showing promising results and a potential domestic demand of 600,000 tons per year. Despite 2020 adjusted EBITDA guidance being revised down to $190-$200 million due to volume reductions, the company expects to generate adjusted EBITDA of $198-$202 million from domestic coke production. Logistics operations have been impacted by the pandemic, but cost reduction efforts are underway. The company remains committed to maintaining its asset base and achieving its revised financial targets.
