In Q2 2020, adjusted EPS grew by 86% to $1.54, while adjusted EBITDA increased to $92 million. Notably, worksite employees paid from new client sales exceeded expectations by 20% and client retention remained high at 99%, reflecting the value and resilience of Insperity's HR services. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, average paid worksite employees declined by only 1.8%, significantly better than the forecasted 1%-5% range. The company also provided service fee credits to clients and benefited from lower benefit and workers' compensation costs, leading to a 27% increase in gross profit. While expenses rose by 9%, cost savings in travel, training, and other areas partially offset these increases. Despite the uncertainty, Insperity remains optimistic about the future, citing the increasing demand for HR services in the small to medium-sized business sector. The company's conservative guidance for the remainder of 2020 is still an improvement over previous guidance, with paid worksite employee growth expected to range from -1% to -3% and adjusted EBITDA growth ranging from -6% to +2%.
