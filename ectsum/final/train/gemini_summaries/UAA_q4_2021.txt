Under Armour delivered record financial results in 2021, with revenue increasing 27% to $5.7 billion. This was driven by growth across all channels, including a strong performance in international markets. Gross margin improved to 50.3%, and net income reached $360 million. The company also made progress in its efforts to improve brand health by reducing sales to off-price channels and exiting undifferentiated retail doors. Despite ongoing uncertainty related to COVID-19, the company remains confident in its ability to deliver sustainable growth over the long term, driven by continued innovation, consumer connectivity, and the execution of its strategic plan. In its most recent quarter, revenue increased 9% to $1.5 billion, while gross margin expanded to 50.7%. The company expects to recognize $525-$550 million in charges related to a restructuring plan and projects a mid-single-digit revenue increase and diluted earnings per share of $0.02-$0.03 for the current transition quarter. While supply chain and inflationary pressures remain, the company's operational agility and strong demand for its brand provide confidence in its ability to navigate these challenges effectively.
