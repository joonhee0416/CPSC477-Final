IDACORP reported a third-quarter decline in earnings per share to $1.93, resulting in a $0.09 drop from the previous year. However, year-to-date earnings remain higher by $0.25 to $4.20, setting a record for the first nine months. The company revised its full-year earnings guidance to $4.80-$4.90 per share, citing a strong economic growth in its service area and robust customer growth of 2.9% since September 2020. Despite the ongoing impact of the pandemic, most commercial and industrial customers are returning to normal operations with unemployment dropping to 2.6% locally. Idaho Power continues to experience high demand for industrial space and interest from renewable energy projects, particularly in dairy waste-to-energy initiatives. Record energy demand and increased wheeling volumes during the summer contributed to increased operating income. Operating and maintenance expenses saw a slight rise due to a return to normal levels of maintenance and purchase services, but full-year O&M expenses are expected to remain within the previously guided range.
