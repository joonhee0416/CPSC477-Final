Aaron's reported a strong start to 2021 with a revenue increase of 11.1% to $481.1 million. Same-store revenue growth reached 14.8%, the first double-digit increase since 2009. This performance was driven by improved lease portfolio quality, strong customer payments, and government stimulus. The company saw a 740 basis point increase in adjusted EBITDA margin to 15.4%, primarily due to lower write-offs and higher same-store revenues. As a result, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased by 313.3% to $1.24. Aaron's also increased its full-year outlook, projecting revenues between $1.725 billion and $1.775 billion, a $75 million increase. The company expects continued improvement in its same-store revenue forecast, now ranging from 4% to 6%.
