Ormat Technologies, a geothermal, solar, and energy storage company, reported continued progress despite the pandemic. Ormat met its 2020 guidance, expanding its portfolio and achieving profitability in its Energy Storage segment. The company's adjusted EBITDA increased by 9.3%, driven by growth in its electricity and storage segments. Revenue also saw a 6.8% increase in the fourth quarter. By 2023, Ormat plans to increase its overall portfolio by 50% to approximately 1.5 gigawatts, with a significant contribution from Energy Storage. This expansion is expected to lead to an annual run rate of $500 million in adjusted EBITDA by the end of 2022, with further growth anticipated in 2023 and beyond. Ormat's robust growth plan includes investments of approximately $450 million in 2021, supported by over $900 million in cash and available capital. The company secured long-term PPAs for the majority of its projects and remains optimistic about the future of renewable energy with the extension of tax credits and California's recent proposal for 1,000 megawatts of new geothermal and long-duration storage procurement.
