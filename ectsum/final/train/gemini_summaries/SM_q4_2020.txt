In 2020, the company achieved significant milestones, generating $240 million in free cash flow and reducing debt by nearly $500 million. Exceptional results were driven by capital efficiency, strong well performance, and cost optimization. The company's five-year plan prioritizes maximizing free cash flow, strengthening the balance sheet (targeting a leverage ratio below 1x by 2027), and maintaining a sustainable reinvestment rate below 75%. For 2021, the plan includes $650-$675 million in capital expenditures, expecting positive free cash flow of approximately $100 million. Allocation focuses on the Midland Basin (90% of DC&E) and South Texas Austin Chalk (increased from preliminary guidance). Drilling efficiency has improved, resulting in a faster pace (17% faster than preliminary guidance). In South Texas, the plan includes testing an electric frack fleet. End-of-year reserves show a robust inventory with high-quality wells (13 years of total company inventory, 9 years in the Midland Basin, with an average IRR of over 50% at $50 oil and $2.50 gas). The company remains committed to ESG stewardship and has established a board-level oversight committee. Key takeaways include improved drilling and completion efficiencies, enhanced well performance in both the Midland Basin and South Texas, a focus on debt reduction and leverage improvement, and a commitment to sustainable operations.
