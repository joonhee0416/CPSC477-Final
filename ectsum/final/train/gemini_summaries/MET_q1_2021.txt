MetLife reported strong Q1 2021 financial results, surpassing consensus expectations with adjusted earnings of $2.20 per share, up 39% year-over-year. This was primarily driven by exceptionally strong variable investment income (VII), particularly in private equity, which returned 13.3%. However, elevated COVID-19-related claims in the US Group Benefits segment impacted earnings, with a mortality ratio of 106.3%, and Latin America saw a 57% decline in adjusted earnings due to underwriting challenges and the pandemic. Despite these setbacks, underlying business fundamentals remained solid, with strong sales growth and expense discipline. MetLife maintained a strong cash position and returned $1.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, while also approving a 4.3% increase in its common stock dividend for Q2. The company remains confident in its future prospects, citing a robust pension risk transfer pipeline, investment in growth, and a commitment to long-term value creation for shareholders.
