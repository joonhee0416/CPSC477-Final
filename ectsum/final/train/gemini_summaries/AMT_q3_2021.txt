American Tower reported another solid quarter with strong performance across its global operations. Consolidated property revenue grew by over 19% year over year, driven by 5G-related projects and elevated wireless capex spending. Organic tenant billings growth remained solid at nearly 5%, with contributions from colocation, amendments, escalators, and churn. Internationally, organic tenant billings growth accelerated to nearly 6%, led by Africa and Latin America. The company expects to continue to drive growth in organic tenant billings, driven by network densification and the buildout of 5G. They are also investing in platform expansion initiatives, including sustainability and renewable energy, to enhance their offerings and capture opportunities arising from the convergence of wireless and wireline networks. The company raised its full year outlook for property revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and AFFO, driven by strength in services, cost discipline, and favorable FX impacts. American Tower remains optimistic about the long-term secular trends driving demand for its infrastructure assets and is well-positioned to benefit from the continued evolution of the wireless ecosystem and next-generation technology.
