Despite facing supply chain disruptions and inflation pressures, Tennant's Q2 results revealed positive growth, particularly in Australia. Organic results in China remained flat due to part availability issues. Gross margin declined year-over-year due to increased costs from freight, materials, and labor, but pricing and cost savings initiatives partially offset these headwinds. Adjusted EBITDA decreased slightly due to cost-saving actions taken during the pandemic in 2020. Adjusted diluted EPS increased to $1.18 per share, driven by lower interest expense. Tennant remains confident in its long-term growth strategy and has set guidance for 2021 with net sales forecasted in the range of $1.09 billion to $1.11 billion, adjusted EPS of $4.10 to $4.50 per diluted share, and adjusted EBITDA of $140 million to $150 million.
