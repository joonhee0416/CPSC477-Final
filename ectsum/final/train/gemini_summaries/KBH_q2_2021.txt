KB Home delivered a strong second quarter, driven by solid operational performance and favorable market conditions. The company achieved diluted earnings per share of $1.50, exceeding analysts' estimates. Total revenues rose 58% to $1.44 billion, largely attributed to a surge in housing revenues, which witnessed a 40% increase. KB Home experienced a robust surge in net orders, reaching a 14-year high for the second quarter, and its backlog grew significantly by 126% to $4.3 billion. The company's profitability metrics improved, with an operating income margin of 11.3% and a gross profit margin of 21.4%. This success was driven by disciplined pricing, operating leverage, and lower interest amortization. Despite facing challenges with supply shortages and municipal delays, KB Home remains confident in achieving its full-year targets. The company anticipates revenues ranging from $5.9 billion to $6.1 billion and expects to expand its operating margin to a range of 11.5% to 12%. KB Home remains committed to returning cash to stockholders through dividends and reducing its debt burden. With a solid balance sheet, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities in the future.
