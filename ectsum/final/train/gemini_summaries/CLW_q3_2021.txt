Clearwater Paper reported solid third-quarter results, with consolidated net sales reaching $450 million and adjusted EBIT of $50 million. The paperboard business benefited from strong demand and price increases, posting an adjusted EBITDA of $43 million, up 14% year-over-year. The tissue business faced challenges due to COVID-related volatility but witnessed improved trends in orders and shipments. The company expects ongoing inflation pressure, particularly in energy, chemicals, and wood fiber, but is mitigating costs through performance improvement initiatives. Clearwater Paper closed the Neenah tissue mill and exited the away-from-home tissue segment, resulting in an annualized benefit of over $10 million. The company plans to pay down debt and invest in capital projects to improve operations and position itself for future success.
