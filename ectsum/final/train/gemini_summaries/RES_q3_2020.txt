Despite improving U.S. oilfield activity in Q3 2020, RPC faced a decline in revenues to $116.6 million and an increase in operating loss to $31.8 million. However, cost management efforts led to lower costs, including a 61% decrease in depreciation and amortization. Notably, RPC recognized a positive EBITDA growth to negative $12.3 million from negative $17.8 million in Q2 2020. The Technical Services segment showed improvement with a 35.7% increase in revenues, while the Support Services segment faced a 16.6% revenue decline. Despite these modest improvements, RPC emphasizes the need for sustained growth in rig count and pricing to achieve sustainable financial returns. The company remains focused on expense management and limited capital investments while maintaining a strong cash balance of $145.6 million and aiming for free cash flow positivity in 2021.
