The Toro Company reported strong third-quarter results, driven by a 16% increase in net sales to $976.8 million, with both the Professional and Residential segments delivering double-digit growth. Professional sales rose 15% to $718.5 million, while Residential sales jumped 23% to $252.1 million. Despite ongoing supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures, earnings per share increased 12.2% to $0.92, exceeding expectations. The company's innovative product portfolio and strong demand propelled these results, with especially robust growth in the residential zero-turn and walk power mower segments. Toro expects the strong demand environment to continue in the fourth quarter and into fiscal 2022 and has raised its full-year guidance. However, the company remains focused on managing supply chain disruptions and other operational headwinds to meet the growing demand.
