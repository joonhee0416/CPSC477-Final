Eaton delivered record-breaking results in Q3, despite supply chain challenges. Revenue growth reached 8% with strong demand, particularly in Electrical Americas, which saw organic growth of 1% and a disproportionate impact from supply chain constraints. However, the Electrical Americas segment still experienced an impressive 17% increase in orders and a 50% increase in backlog. Overall, Eaton reported an all-time high adjusted earnings per share of $1.75 and a 230 basis point increase in segment margins to 19.9%. The company also achieved a strong 46% incremental margin due to cost mitigation measures, portfolio changes, and restructuring savings. Although revenues were lower than expected, Eaton remains optimistic about future quarters, with a solid Q4 guidance and preliminary assumptions indicating attractive growth in key end markets for 2022.
