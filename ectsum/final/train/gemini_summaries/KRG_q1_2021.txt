KRG's Q1 performance exceeded expectations amidst positive COVID news. Tenant reopenings and strong leasing activity drove collections to 97%, while signed leases reached 426,000 square feet with blended lease spreads of 12.2% and 6.4% on a GAAP and cash basis respectively. Signed NOI of $10 million is expected online in late 2021 and early 2022. The company's portfolio expansion aligns with the migration to Sun Belt markets, highlighted by the Apple announcement in Raleigh, where KRG owns an adjacent center. Despite negative same-store NOI growth due to COVID vacancies, the company remains optimistic about its revenue potential. The balance sheet is solid with net debt to EBITDA at 6.6 times, and the company has raised its 2021 FFO guidance to $1.26-$1.34 per share, assuming full-year bad debt of $7.6 million.
