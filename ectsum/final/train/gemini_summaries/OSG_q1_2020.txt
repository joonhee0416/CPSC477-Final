Amidst disruptions caused by COVID-19, Ocean Shipholdings (OSG) showcased resilient performance in Q1, benefiting from a substantial time charter book. Vessel employment reached 95% in Q2 and 86% for the remaining year. The acquisition of Alaskan tankers, effective March 12th, significantly contributed to revenue with $3.4 million in TCE earnings during their partial quarter operation. Despite reduced cargo volumes in the Jones Act business due to low refinery runs, strong international tanker rates provided support. OSG remains optimistic about improving trends in gasoline consumption and diesel's relative stability. It acknowledges uncertainties posed by COVID-19 but is committed to cost management and maintaining operational readiness. While providing forward guidance is challenging, OSG expects Q2 time charter equivalent earnings to reach $100 million, putting it on track for $395-$400 million in annualized earnings in the first half of 2020. The company remains confident in its long-term outlook, citing high barriers to entry, limited new capacity in the next few years, and its culture of safety and service quality.
