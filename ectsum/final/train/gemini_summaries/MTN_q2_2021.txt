Despite COVID-19 impacts, Vail Resorts showcased strong visitation at its resorts, with only a 5% decline compared to the previous year. Local visitation remained steady, while destination visitation was more robust than anticipated. Season pass sales surged by 20%, driving demand and accounting for 71% of visitation, compared to 59% last year. The company maintained disciplined cost control, reporting a resort EBITDA margin of 40.3%. Net income was $147.8 million, or $3.62 per share, down from $5.04 per share last year, reflecting COVID-19's adverse effects. Nevertheless, the resort remains confident in its cash flow generation and will strategically invest in capital projects to enhance guest experiences while pursuing strategic acquisitions. To improve customer service, the company is enhancing technology and adding staff to its call centers. Despite a suspension in dividend payments, Vail Resorts is committed to returning capital to shareholders in the future.
