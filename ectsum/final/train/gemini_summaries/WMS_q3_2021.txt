Driven by the execution of material conversion strategies and a favorable demand environment, the company achieved another quarter of record financial performance. Sales surged 24%, fueled by 17% growth in non-residential sales (with allied product sales increasing 23%) and 36% growth in residential sales. These increases were observed across all end markets, including strong performance in the Atlantic Coast, Southeast, Northeast, and Western United States. International sales also saw an 18% increase, primarily driven by Canada. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased by 540 basis points, driven by favorable pricing, material costs, and operational productivity initiatives. Despite cost headwinds in the fourth quarter, the company is confident in offsetting them through pricing adjustments, level loading, and continuous productivity initiatives. The company expects continued growth in horizontal construction and residential development, supported by strong market indicators and their focus on material conversion and water management strategies.
