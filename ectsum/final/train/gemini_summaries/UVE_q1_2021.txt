Universal Insurance Holdings reported a strong first quarter with 11.7% revenue growth to $262.8 million, driven by rate increases and an improved investment portfolio. Margins expanded by 210 basis points, leading to adjusted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.84, equal to GAAP EPS. Direct premiums written increased by 9.2%, primarily due to growth in Florida. The combined ratio improved to 93.1% with favorable loss development and claims adjusting benefits. Despite higher reinsurance costs, operating efficiencies led to an improvement in the expense ratio. Net investment income declined due to lower yields, while total invested assets increased by 10.6%. The company repurchased a small number of shares and declared a quarterly dividend of $0.16 per share. Universal Insurance maintained its 2021 guidance, expecting adjusted EPS within a range of $2.75 to $3 and a return on equity between 17% and 19%, assuming no extraordinary weather events.
