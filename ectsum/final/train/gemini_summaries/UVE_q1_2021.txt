Universal Insurance Holdings reported a strong Q1 with 11.7% revenue growth to $262.8 million, primarily driven by primary rate increases and lower reinsurance costs. Margins expanded by 210 basis points due to increased top line fall-through profit, lower losses, and reduced operating expenses. Direct premiums written grew by 9.2%, led by Florida's 10.2% growth, while the combined ratio improved by 1 point to 93.1% due to decreased weather losses, favorable prior year reserve development, and claims adjusting benefits. Despite lower net investment income, the company's investment portfolio increased by 10.6%, and the total return on average equity reached 23.2%. The company remains optimistic about positive strides in 2021, with expectations of adjusted EPS between $2.75 and $3 and an ROE of 17% to 19%.
