Despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, APS remains confident in its financial health and long-term growth prospects. The company's strong balance sheet, A- credit rating, and sufficient liquidity provide financial stability. Operationally, the seamless transition to remote work and the implementation of pandemic plans ensure reliable power delivery. While sales may lag in the near term, the company expects long-term growth driven by Arizona's booming tech sector and robust job market. APS remains committed to its $4.7 billion capex forecast, primarily for clean energy investments, but acknowledges the potential for adjustments based on COVID-19 impacts. With ample flexibility and additional O&M savings under assessment, APS believes its 2020 consolidated earnings per diluted share guidance of $4.75 to $4.95 remains achievable, assuming COVID-19 impacts dissipate by the end of Q2.
