Graco reported a strong third quarter, with sales increasing by 11% year-over-year to $487 million, driven by growth in Industrial and Process segments. However, higher product costs impacted gross margin, decreasing by 110 basis points despite price increases and increased factory volume. Operating expenses rose by 19% due to sales and volume-based expenses, new product spending, and currency translation. Despite challenges in the Contractor segment due to supply chain constraints, overall demand remained robust, with order rates exceeding billings in all segments. Backlogs increased significantly, reaching $280 million at the end of the quarter. Looking ahead, the company anticipates mid-to-high-teen organic revenue growth for the full year and expects pricing actions in 2022 to offset current cost pressures.
