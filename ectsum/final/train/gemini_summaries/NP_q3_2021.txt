Net sales surged 40% in Q3 to a record $267.9 million, primarily driven by strong demand and the acquisition of Itasa. However, escalating input costs and supply chain disruptions led to margin challenges, and despite price increases, the company expects to recover only about half of the $40 million increase in input costs this year. Margins are expected to improve in Q4 and 2022 as pricing initiatives gain momentum. The company remains focused on growth, particularly in targeted platforms such as filtration, specialty coatings, engineered materials, and packaging. Innovation and M&A are seen as key drivers of strategy, and the closure of the Appleton facility is expected to generate significant cost savings. Despite near-term headwinds, the company aims to grow revenue by 5% and earnings by 10% in the long term.
