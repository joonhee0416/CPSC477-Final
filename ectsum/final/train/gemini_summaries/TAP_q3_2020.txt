Molson Coors reported strong third-quarter results, exceeding expectations in both revenue and earnings. Despite the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, the company's iconic core brands, Coors Light and Miller Lite, grew 6% and 9.5%, respectively, in the U.S. off-premise market. Molson also highlighted the success of its above-premium portfolio, with Blue Moon Lightsky and Vizzy driving incremental case sales. The company's emerging growth division, which includes non-beer beverages and cannabis-infused products, is projected to generate $1 billion in revenue within three years. To support its growth strategy, Molson is investing in its production capacity, with plans to expand hard seltzer production by over 400% and Blue Moon Lightsky production by approximately 400%. The company is also prioritizing capital projects that will expand its production capacity for seltzers and innovations. Despite supply chain challenges, inventory is improving in the U.S., and the company expects to return to full inventory of 12-ounce industry standard cans by year-end. However, the company acknowledges the ongoing challenges and uncertainties presented by the pandemic and remains focused on navigating these challenges while driving long-term value creation.
