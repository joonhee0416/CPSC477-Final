The company's first quarter results reflect the strength of their strategy, with FFO per share increasing by 10% year-over-year to $0.56. NOI from real estate operations also saw a 6% increase. The leasing market is strong, as evidenced by the completion of 258,000 square feet of leases in the first quarter and 662,000 square feet in April. Development leasing is also expected to close on nearly 900,000 square feet in the coming months. The company's recent bond issuance was a success, with a 2.75% coupon and high demand from investors. The improved outlook for same-property cash NOI and interest savings from the bond refinancing have driven the $0.03 increase in the midpoint of 2021 guidance for FFO per share, which at the midpoint implies 4.7% growth over 2020.
