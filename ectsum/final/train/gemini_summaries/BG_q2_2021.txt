Despite second quarter results lower than last year's strong performance, Bunge exceeded expectations with quarterly record highs in soy crush volume and capacity utilization. Refined and Specialty Oils also improved, particularly in North America due to increased foodservice demand and demand for renewable diesel. The company has updated its full-year earnings forecast to at least $8.50 per share, demonstrating confidence in the second half of the year. Furthermore, Bunge increased its mid-cycle earnings baseline by $2 per share to $7, reflecting fundamental market shifts and business improvements. The company highlights opportunities for earnings upside through strategic acquisitions, expanding its refined oils position, developing renewable feedstocks and plant-based proteins, and investing in technology. This increased baseline is expected to generate approximately $800 million of discretionary cash annually for reinvestment or shareholder returns. Bunge emphasizes the structural shift in consumer demand for sustainable food, feed, and fuel, and its role in supporting this change.
