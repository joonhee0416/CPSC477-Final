The company reported a strong third quarter with increased cash flow, occupancy gains, and leasing volumes. Its domestic operations performed particularly well, with NOI increasing 24.5% year over year and occupancy reaching 92.8%. International operations also improved, although the quarter fell slightly short of expectations due to COVID restrictions. The company emphasized the importance of cash flow growth and highlighted its focus on unique growth levers beyond its real estate portfolio. It announced a 10% increase in its quarterly dividend to $1.65 per share and raised its FY FFO guidance to $11.55-$11.65 per share. Management believes the company is undervalued at a multiple of 13 times and sees potential for strong performance in an inflationary cycle.
