Despite ongoing COVID-19 uncertainty, Under Armour delivered strong fourth-quarter results, beating expectations with revenue of $1.4 billion. This was driven by higher-than-anticipated demand in both wholesale and direct-to-consumer (DTC) channels. While licensing declined, accessories surged 32% due to demand for SPORTSMASK. Excluding restructuring charges, gross margin increased 300 basis points to 50.3%. SG&A expenses declined 4%. The company ended the quarter with a solid cash position of $1.5 billion.

Looking ahead to 2021, Under Armour expects high single-digit revenue growth, with a high single-digit increase in North America and high-teens growth internationally. However, revenue headwinds include the absence of MyFitnessPal, constrained orders, and the exit of undifferentiated wholesale distribution. Despite these challenges, the company plans to maintain its discipline on supply and demand planning and inventory management. Gross margin is expected to increase slightly against 2020's adjusted rate of 48.6%, with benefits from pricing and supply chain efficiency offset by the sale of MyFitnessPal. SG&A expenses are expected to grow slightly, with investments in DTC, international, and marketing to support growth expectations. Operating income is projected at $5 to $25 million, with adjusted operating income at $130 to $150 million. Diluted loss per share is expected to be $0.18 to $0.20, while adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to be $0.12 to $0.14.
