The company's utilities and subsidiaries performed well during the recent winter weather event, highlighting the benefits of the company's vertically integrated structure and resource planning process. Plant Vogtle Unit 3's Hot Functional Testing is underway, with a scheduled fuel load in the third quarter of 2021 and an in-service date of late December 2021 (with potential for a first quarter 2022 in-service date). Unit 4 construction is 80% complete, with an estimated completion in the third quarter of 2022 and an in-service date of November 22, 2022. The company allocated $84 million to contingency for Unit 3, reflecting the extended schedule and potential cost risks.

The economies in the company's service territories are showing signs of recovery, and strong economic development trends continue in the region. The company recently sold its wholesale gas trading and services business, which was excluded from adjusted earnings, resulting in no impact on adjusted earnings per share expectations for the year. Southern Power has acquired two wind facilities, expanding its renewable portfolio to nearly 5,000 megawatts.
