Cleveland-Cliffs reported record quarterly revenue, net income, and adjusted EBITDA in Q2, driven by increased steel pricing, favorable product mix, and higher volumes. Despite inflationary pressures, the company's self-sufficiency in raw materials has mitigated cost increases. Demand for steel remains strong across all sectors, and Cleveland-Cliffs expects to break its Q2 records in Q3 with an estimated adjusted EBITDA of $1.8 billion, leading to continued robust free cash flow generation. The company is prioritizing debt repayment and has made significant progress, reducing debt-to-cap ratio to a nine-year low. Cleveland-Cliffs is also focused on renegotiating existing contracts to improve returns. Despite supply chain disruptions in the automotive sector, the company has successfully diverted volume to spot buyers and other contract clients. The company is also investing in decarbonization initiatives, such as the Toledo Direct Reduction plant, and exploring the use of natural gas as a reduction agent. Overall, Cleveland-Cliffs' strong Q2 performance and positive outlook for Q3 demonstrate its operational and commercial success and its continued commitment to creating value for shareholders.
