HCA Healthcare experienced a significant rebound in Q2 with revenue growth of 30% to $14.4 billion, driven by increased demand for services as COVID-19 admissions declined to 3%. Inpatient revenues increased 20% due to higher admissions, while outpatient revenues surged 59%, supported by growth in surgeries, emergency room visits, and urgent care. Compared to pre-pandemic levels, inpatient admissions increased almost 3% and outpatient surgeries grew approximately 3.5%. The improved payer mix further contributed to higher margins. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved, and diluted earnings per share increased 35% to $4.37, excluding government stimulus income. Despite the strong performance, cash flow from operations declined year-over-year due to the absence of CARES Act receipts in Q2 2021. The company plans to invest aggressively in strategic initiatives, including clinical capability expansion and enterprise resource development. Guidance for the full year has been raised, with adjusted EBITDA estimated to range from $12.1 billion to $12.5 billion and diluted earnings per share projected between $16.30 and $17.10.
