In Q2, Oxford Industries faced revenue challenges due to reduced traffic and closures, resulting in a 36% decline year-over-year. However, e-commerce surged 52%, led by Lilly Pulitzer's remarkable 142% growth. Digital marketing efforts and a successful June flash sale contributed to Lilly's success. Despite a 5% gross margin decline, cost reduction efforts yielded a 19% decline in SG&A. The company ended the quarter with strong liquidity, including $257 million of unused availability under its credit facility. While Q3 is expected to show a continued revenue decline, Oxford anticipates a break-even approach in Q4 and a return to profitability in fiscal 2021. The company has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share amidst its financial challenges.
