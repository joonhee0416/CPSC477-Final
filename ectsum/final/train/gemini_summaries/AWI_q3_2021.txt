Armstrong World Industries reported strong third-quarter results despite market challenges. Sales grew 19%, driven by Mineral Fiber sales (up 15%) and Architectural Specialties sales (up 31%). Adjusted EBITDA increased 8%, with the Mineral Fiber segment contributing 10% growth due to positive AUV and WAVE joint venture earnings. Despite a rare manufacturing equipment failure, the company reaffirmed its full-year guidance, expecting 17-18% revenue growth, 13-15% adjusted EBITDA growth, and 14-16% adjusted earnings per share growth. The company is proactively managing inflation and supply chain disruptions, having successfully implemented price increases that have outpaced inflationary pressures. Armstrong's commitment to staying ahead of inflation has allowed it to achieve historically high gross margins. Notably, the Mineral Fiber segment achieved an AUV growth of 14%, the highest level since 2016, largely driven by like-for-like pricing improvements. The company's best-in-class service performance, tracked by six key metrics, has remained above 90% throughout 2021. Additionally, the company highlighted the success of its SimpleSoffit innovation, which has gained traction and created value for customers in commercial construction, including high-profile projects.
