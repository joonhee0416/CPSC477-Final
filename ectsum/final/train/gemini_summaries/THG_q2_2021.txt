Hanover Insurance Group delivered exceptional second-quarter results, reporting an 11.7% increase in net written premiums, surpassing pre-COVID-19 growth levels in all segments. Strong operating income of $104 million and an operating return on equity of 14.7% showcase their financial strength. The combined ratio of 94.4% reflects a robust underwriting performance, driven by earned rate increases and lingering frequency benefits in auto lines. Personal Lines growth accelerated to 11.6%, supported by solid retention and new business production. Commercial Lines witnessed a substantial 11.7% growth, fueled by specialty and small commercial businesses. Hanover's expense ratio improved to 31.2%, and they remain confident in achieving a 30 basis point improvement for the full year. Despite some elevated large losses, overall Commercial Lines profitability remained strong. Personal Lines exhibited a favorable combined ratio of 85.3%, benefiting from lower auto claim frequency. The company prudently manages its loss selections, considering inflation and potential social inflation. Looking ahead, Hanover expects continued growth in all segments, projecting mid- to high single-digit premium growth and an improved ex-CAT combined ratio outlook of 89% to 90% for the full year.
