Robert Half reported strong Q4 results, with both Protiviti and staffing divisions exceeding guidance. Protiviti reported its 13th consecutive quarter of year-on-year revenue gains, with particular strength in its technology consulting practice. Staffing operations reported broad-based, double-digit quarter-on-quarter sequential revenue growth. Despite a 15% decrease in companywide revenues, Protiviti reported an 18% increase in global revenues on an as-adjusted basis. Combined segment income reached $130 million, with a combined segment margin of 9.9%. The company's strategic investments in technology, its focus on mid-cap clients, and its collaboration between Protiviti and staffing operations position it for continued growth in 2021 and beyond, as economists expect GDP growth to follow the rollout of vaccines and continued fiscal and monetary policy support.
