OPTAVIA reported a strong Q2 with revenue soaring 79% to $394 million, driven by a surge in active earning coaches (up 62% year-over-year) and improved coach productivity (revenue per coach rose 14%). The absence of promotions this quarter led to a 210 basis point increase in gross margin. OPTAVIA is investing heavily in technology, including mobile apps for coaches and clients, to drive growth. The company is also expanding its supply chain capacity to meet rising demand, with manufacturing capacity reaching $2 billion six months ahead of schedule and fulfillment capacity set to be finalized in Q3. In addition to financial success, OPTAVIA's convention returned to a hybrid format, fostering community engagement and showcasing the company's commitment to health and wellness. With its focus on empowering coaches and providing holistic solutions, OPTAVIA is poised for continued growth.
