Cedar Shopping Centers emerged from the third quarter of 2020 with remarkable resilience, particularly in its core grocery-anchored shopping centers. The company boasts an impressive 91% rent collection rate, among the highest in the retail REIT sector. To navigate the challenges posed by the pandemic, Cedar has adopted a zero-based approach to G&A, resulting in anticipated savings of over $2 million in 2021. Additionally, the team has actively engaged with tenants to provide deferrals and waivers, totaling $3 million in deferred rent and $900,000 in waived rent. Despite the pandemic's impact, Cedar continues to execute new leasing deals with a positive spread of 21.5%. The company anticipates closing secured loans in early 2021 to refinance its $75 million term loan, providing flexibility in the face of potential market disruptions. Cedar's redevelopment projects are also progressing, with the DGS building at Northeast Heights poised to commence construction in early 2021. As it emerges from this challenging period, Cedar is well-positioned to capitalize on the resilience of grocery-anchored shopping centers and its strategic focus on urban mixed-use projects.
