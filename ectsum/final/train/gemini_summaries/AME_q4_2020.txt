AMETEK concluded 2020 with a record-breaking fourth quarter, despite facing challenges due to the pandemic. Sales, orders, and backlog all showed sequential improvements, with several businesses reporting positive year-over-year growth. The exceptional operating performance led to record margins and cash flow. Despite the impact of COVID-19 on commercial aerospace, the Electronic Instruments and Electromechanical Groups delivered strong results. AMETEK remains confident in its long-term growth potential, driven by its asset-light business model, leading market positions, and skilled workforce. The company ended 2020 with a strong financial position, including a low debt-to-EBITDA ratio and ample liquidity. This provides flexibility for strategic acquisitions and managing the ongoing economic downturn.
