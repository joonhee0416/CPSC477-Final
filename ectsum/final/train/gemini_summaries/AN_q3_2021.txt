AutoNation reported record quarterly earnings with EPS of $5.12, a 115% increase year-over-year, marking its sixth consecutive record quarter. This growth was driven by a combination of strong same-store revenue gains (18% year-over-year) and increased margins. Consumer demand continues to outpace supply, with new vehicle sales constrained by low inventory levels, and this trend is expected to continue into 2022. The company's used vehicle business also performed exceptionally well, with strong self-sourcing capabilities and digital tools contributing to a 90% self-sourcing rate and a 63% increase in same-store used vehicle revenue. AutoNation also announced the acquisition of Priority 1 Automotive Group, adding $420 million in annual revenue, and authorized an additional $1 billion in share repurchases. Despite significant capital deployment, the company maintains ample balance sheet capacity, with a covenant leverage ratio of 1.4 times debt to EBITDA.
