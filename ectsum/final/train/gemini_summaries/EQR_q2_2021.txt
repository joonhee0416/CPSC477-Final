EQR's operating metrics continue to improve, with demand exceeding pre-pandemic levels. This has led to increased occupancy and rate hikes, resulting in upwardly revised annual same-store revenue, NOI, and normalized FFO guidance. Despite negative quarter-over-quarter same-store revenue and NOI results, the decline was less severe than anticipated, and sequential revenue and NOI growth has returned. The company expects continued growth beginning in 2022, driven by recovering revenue losses, strong demand, and a more diverse portfolio. Investment activity remains high, with recent acquisitions in Austin, Atlanta, Denver, and suburbs of Boston and Washington, D.C., targeting affluent renters. Strong expense control and favorable real estate tax outcomes have also contributed to improved guidance. The midpoint of expense guidance has been lowered to 3%, due in part to lower real estate tax growth and optimized staffing. As a result, normalized FFO has been raised to $2.90. Despite the pandemic's impact on operations, the company's balance sheet remains strong, with credit metrics within policy range. The attractive debt capital markets present opportunities for strategic debt refinancing.
