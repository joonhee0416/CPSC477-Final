In Q2, the company achieved record sales of $342.1 million, a 38% increase year-over-year and a 12% increase compared to pre-pandemic levels in 2019. This was driven by strong demand in both Engine Management and Temperature Control segments. Market shifts toward professional vehicle installations, the return of miles driven, and deferred repairs contributed to the sales surge. Despite facing supply chain challenges, the company managed labor shortages and inflationary pressures, resulting in a 29% gross margin. Operating expenses were elevated due to higher sales and distribution costs, but the company achieved strong leverage due to its sales performance. Net profits surged to $1.26 per share, a 140% increase over 2020 and nearly 40% greater than 2019. The company acquired Trombetta, a leader in mechanical and electronic power switching devices, expanding its original equipment business to an annual run rate of $250 million. Despite the unusually strong performance in the last 18 months, the company anticipates a moderation in growth due to pent-up demand and potential supply chain headwinds.
