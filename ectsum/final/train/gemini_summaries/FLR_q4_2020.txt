Fluor Corporation reported a 2020 net loss of $294 million, reflecting impairments and COVID-19 impacts. Moving forward, the company is prioritizing balance sheet stability through debt retirement and divestitures. For 2021, Fluor anticipates booking a pipeline of projects that align with its revised pursuit criteria, projecting adjusted earnings per share of $0.50 to $0.80. This guidance excludes NuScale expenses, foreign currency fluctuations, restructuring, or impairments. Despite lower awards in 2020 creating a headwind for 2021 earnings, Fluor remains optimistic about growth in the second half of the year. The company is well-positioned in end markets such as urban solutions (e.g., mining, advanced technologies, life sciences), infrastructure, mission solutions (e.g., intelligence, cyber), and energy solutions. Fluor expects NuScale initiatives to provide significant returns over time and is evaluating new investors to capitalize on its clean energy investment. The company anticipates average full-year margins of 2-3% in Urban Solutions, 2.5-3% in Mission Solutions, and 2.5-3.5% in Energy Solutions, improving as the year progresses. Fluor maintains its long-term guidance of earnings per share between $3 and $3.50 by 2024, as COVID headwinds gradually subside and project awards resume to drive profitability.
