In its recent earnings call, Fluor outlined strategic changes and financial targets. The company prioritized end markets with technical expertise, pursuing contracts with favorable terms and fostering a high-performance culture. Despite pandemic-induced delays in new awards, Fluor maintains long-term guidance of $3.00 to $3.50 EPS by 2024. Key end markets, particularly mining in urban solutions, are showing positive momentum, while advanced technologies and life sciences offer growth opportunities. Fluor expects new awards to pick up in the second half of 2021, leading to significant EPS growth in 2022. For 2021, adjusted EPS guidance is set at $0.50 to $0.80 per share, with slight revenue decline anticipated. Margins are expected to improve as the year progresses, with full-year margins ranging from 2% to 3.5% across business segments. Fluor remains committed to stabilizing its capital structure through debt retirement and divestitures, with a focus on end markets where it can maximize revenue and margin expansion.
