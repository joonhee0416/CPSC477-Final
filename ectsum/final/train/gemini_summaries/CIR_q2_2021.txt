CIRCOR reported solid Q2 results, driven by a 27% surge in Industrial organic orders, despite headwinds from inflation and COVID-19 supplier issues. Revenue and earnings met guidance at $190 million and $14.6 million, respectively. The backlog remained strong at $436 million, providing visibility for a robust second half. Aerospace & Defense orders declined due to the timing of large defense orders, but are expected to improve in the latter half of the year. CIRCOR highlighted its strategic priorities, including investing in growth by launching 21 new products in the first half and expanding regionally by securing a multiproduct pump order from Daewoo Shipbuilding in Korea. The company's focus on margin expansion and debt reduction through free cash flow was also emphasized. A recent customer perception study confirmed CIRCOR's alignment with customer priorities, with a Net Promoter Score of 67 indicating exceptional product quality and technical support.
