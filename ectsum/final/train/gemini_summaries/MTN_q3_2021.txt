Vail Resorts experienced a successful third quarter, reporting strong visitation at its Colorado and Utah resorts. While overall destination visitation was only down 3% compared to 2019, Whistler Blackcomb faced challenges due to international travel restrictions, resulting in a 60% decline. Ancillary businesses continued to be impacted by capacity constraints, but cost controls led to a strong EBITDA margin of 52%. Despite ongoing COVID-19 restrictions, Vail Resorts remains optimistic, with projected fiscal 2021 net income ranging from $93 million to $139 million and EBITDA between $530 million and $570 million. The company is also investing in resort enhancements, technology upgrades, and employee wages, demonstrating its commitment to the guest experience and long-term success. Pass product sales for the upcoming season are significantly up compared to 2019, with strong growth in both new and renewing passholders, particularly in destination markets.
