Quanex Building Products faced a decline in revenue to $187.5 million in Q2 2020, a 14.2% decrease from $218.2 million in Q2 2019, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the revenue decline, the company reported net income of $5.5 million ($0.17 per share), an improvement compared to the net loss of $24 million ($0.73 per share) in Q2 2019. Adjusted earnings per share remained stable at $0.19. EBITDA also remained relatively stable at $21.8 million, showing the company's ability to offset volume declines through lower SG&A expenses. Quanex maintains a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity and a leverage ratio of 1.4 times, which is unchanged from the previous quarter. The company expects an improvement in working capital in the second half of the year and has reduced its capital expenditure program to $20-$25 million, with $30-$35 million in free cash flow anticipated. Quanex anticipates a gradual recovery, with Q3 revenue expected to decline by 20-25% in North America and 40-45% in Europe compared to the previous year. Despite the challenges presented by the pandemic, the company remains optimistic and is seeing signs of improvement.
