MDU Resources reported second quarter earnings per share of $0.50, unchanged from the same period in 2020. Higher stock-based compensation and healthcare costs, as well as lower investment returns, impacted the results. The utility business saw a decrease in earnings due to increased operating expenses, partially offset by higher gross margin. The natural gas utility segment reported an improved seasonal loss compared to last year. The pipeline business had a slight increase in earnings driven by nonregulated project revenues and increased allowance for funds used during construction. Construction services reported record earnings due to strong demand for both inside and outside specialty contracting. The construction materials business had slightly lower earnings but is operating near-record levels with strong demand. The company remains optimistic about its construction businesses and sees potential opportunities from infrastructure funding packages. MDU Resources maintains a strong balance sheet and has provided consistent dividends for shareholders. The company expects full-year 2021 earnings per share in the range of $2.00 to $2.15 and revenue guidance for both construction materials and construction services businesses in the range of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion.
