Brinker International reported solid top-line performance in Q1, with sales and traffic numbers remaining strong despite industry-wide challenges related to staffing and supply chain issues. The company incurred increased costs in training and overtime due to a high turnover rate, which impacted profitability. However, management expects these transitory costs to subside in the second half of the year. Brinker has taken strategic pricing actions to offset structural cost increases, while maintaining a focus on protecting traffic performance and margins. The company's strong balance sheet and reduced leverage position have improved its financial flexibility. Despite near-term challenges, Brinker remains optimistic about its long-term prospects, reiterating its guidance for annual revenue between $3.75 billion and $3.85 billion and adjusted EPS between $3.50 and $3.80. The expected gradual improvement in restaurant operating margins in Q2 is a positive sign.
