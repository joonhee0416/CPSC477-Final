Graco Inc. reported a revenue decline of 8% to $374 million in Q1 2020, impacted by currency translation rates and lower sales in the Contractor segment. Net earnings totaled $73 million ($0.42 per diluted share) before adjustments, reducing to $65 million ($0.38 per diluted share) after accounting for tax benefits. Operating expenses declined due to reduced volume and earnings-based expenses, partially offset by higher product development costs. Despite economic uncertainty leading to withdrawn revenue guidance, Graco remains committed to maintaining its payroll, continuing growth strategies, and preserving financial flexibility. The company's solid balance sheet and high employee morale position it well to navigate the current challenges and rebound when end markets improve.
