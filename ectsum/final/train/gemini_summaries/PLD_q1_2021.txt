Prologis' positive momentum from Q4 carried into 2021, fueled by strong demand driven by economic recovery, e-commerce growth, and rising inventory levels. Lease proposals hit a record high of 93 million square feet, while lease signings reached 60 million square feet, second highest on record. Despite high lease volumes, the operating portfolio remained 96.4% leased with a diverse mix and elevated e-commerce demand. In the US, net absorption is expected to reach a record 300 million square feet, while supply remains disciplined with shortages of desirable land and high replacement costs. Rising demand and low vacancies have led to strong pricing power, with rent growth forecasts raised to 6.5% in the US and 6% globally. Core FFO per share was $0.97 for the quarter, driven by a 27% net effective rent change on rollover. The company raised its 2021 core FFO guidance to $3.96-$4.02 per share, with a 12% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Prologis' strong balance sheet and liquidity position, coupled with its strategic capital activities, set the stage for continued outperformance in 2021 and beyond.
