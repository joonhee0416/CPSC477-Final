Stifel Financial's first quarter of 2021 marked another record, with revenue surpassing $1.14 billion, an increase of 24%. This growth was driven by both Global Wealth Management and Institutional Groups, resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.50, an increase of 88% year-on-year. The company's investment in its business and the strength of the operating environment contributed to these record results. Global Wealth Management experienced an 8% year-over-year increase in revenue, driven by asset management and brokerage revenue growth. The Institutional Group posted a consecutive record quarter, with revenue reaching $506 million, a 52% increase from the prior year. Investment banking revenue also set a record, exceeding last quarter's record by $339 million. Stifel's pre-tax margin climbed to 21%, while the operating expense ratio came in at approximately 16% due to strong revenue performance and expense management. The company also saw a $5 million credit provision reversal, bolstering its pre-provision income by 61%.
