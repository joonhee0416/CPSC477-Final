The company reported robust Q2 results, driven by elevated demand, expanded distribution, and strong execution, resulting in 12.7% organic sales growth. Adjusted earnings per share more than doubled to $0.77, driven by synergy realization, favorable currencies, and lower interest expense. Despite inflationary headwinds, the company's cost control and synergy realization partially offset these pressures. Given the first-half performance, the company raised its full-year outlook, now expecting net sales growth of 5-7%, adjusted earnings per share of $3.30-$3.50, and adjusted EBITDA of $620-$640 million. Battery demand remained elevated, with Energizer outpacing category growth globally. US AutoCare saw 7.4% category growth, with Energizer again outperforming. The company realized $20 million in synergies this quarter and has surpassed $100 million since the Battery and Auto Care acquisitions. Its favorable debt refinancings are expected to contribute to a $30 million reduction in 2021 interest expense.
