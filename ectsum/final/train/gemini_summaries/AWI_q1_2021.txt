Armstrong Corporation reported positive results for Q1 2021, with a 2% increase in adjusted sales to $253 million, driven by strong growth in acquisitions that offset COVID-19-related declines. Adjusted EBITDA fell 12% to $85 million due to COVID-19 volume reductions, investments in growth initiatives, and resumed spending. The Mineral Fiber segment posted a 5% sales decline but saw a positive shipping rate trend in March and April. The Architectural Specialties segment delivered a 25% increase in sales, led by 2020 acquisitions. The company remains confident in its full-year guidance of +10% to +13% net sales and adjusted EBITDA of +9% to +13% despite inflationary pressures. Armstrong is well-positioned for continued growth through its Healthy Spaces initiatives, such as the 24/7 defend product line and its innovative digital platform, Kanopi by Armstrong, which provides data-driven insights and simplifies the purchasing process for small-scale commercial spaces.
