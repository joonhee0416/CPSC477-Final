Despite the strained labor market and increased material costs, Wabash delivered strong Q1 results, with operating profit and earnings per share exceeding expectations. Robust demand for transportation, logistics, and distribution services, especially in the final mile truck body business, drove these results. However, labor shortages and supply chain disruptions impacted productivity. The company expects these headwinds to subside in 2022. Revenue is projected to be in the range of $1.95 to $2.05 billion for the full year and $450 to $480 million in Q2. Despite a decrease in operating margins to 3.4% in Q2, earnings per share are expected to be between $0.10 and $0.15. Wabash remains committed to manufacturing talent integration, organic growth, and debt reduction.
