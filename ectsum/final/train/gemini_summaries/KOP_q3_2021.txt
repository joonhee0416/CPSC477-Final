Koppers experienced mixed results in Q3 2021, with lower-than-expected performance in the Railroad and Utility Products and Services (RUPS) segment. The company's consolidated sales decreased slightly year-over-year, primarily due to declining RUPS volumes and PC sales. However, the Performance Chemicals (PC) and Chemical Materials and Commodities (CM&C) segments saw increased sales, driven by higher pricing and strong demand. Despite headwinds from the pandemic, Koppers remains optimistic about its future, particularly in the PC and CM&C segments. The company anticipates continued sales growth in PC due to a strong demand outlook and price increases. CM&C is also expected to benefit from strong demand in aluminum and steel markets. Overall, Koppers is confident in its ability to overcome short-term challenges and achieve its 2025 goal of $300 million in EBITDA.

Total sales fell from $438 million in Q3 2020 to $425 million in Q3 2021. Adjusted EBITDA decreased from $67 million to $54 million. Sales for RUPS, PC, and CM&C were $187 million, $115 million, and $123 million, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA for RUPS, PC, and CM&C were $11 million, $20 million, and $23 million, respectively. The company has reviewed potential financing options for its $500 million senior notes and bank credit facility but will not move forward with any transaction at this time. Koppers is implementing a monthly healthcare surcharge to unvaccinated employees.
