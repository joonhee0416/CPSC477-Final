PCA reported a strong Q1 with net income reaching $167 million ($1.75 per share) before special items. Excluding these items, net income reached $169 million ($1.77 per share), a significant increase from the $143 million ($1.50 per share) in Q1 2020. The Packaging segment drove this growth with increased volumes and prices, totaling $352 million in EBITDA, up from $290 million last year. Despite rising operating costs due to inflation and higher freight expenses, cost-reduction initiatives and completed projects helped mitigate these impacts. PCA's strong demand and plant performance allowed them to continue record-breaking containerboard and corrugated product shipments, although inventory remained lower than planned. The company also updated its full-year guidance, adjusting the estimated cost impact of maintenance outages to $0.97 per share and expanding capital spending to $650-$675 million. PCA is converting No. 3 paper machine at Jackson Mill to linerboard, a strategic move that will provide internal supply and optimize operations. In Q2, PCA anticipates continued strong demand in Packaging, higher paper prices, and some inflationary pressures, with annual outage expenses higher than Q1.
