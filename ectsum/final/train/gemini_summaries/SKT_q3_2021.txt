In Q3, Tanger delivered strong results exceeding expectations with core FFO per share of $0.47. Occupancy levels (94.3%) reached pre-pandemic levels, supported by strong rent spreads (240 basis point increase in blended average rates). The company also saw significant growth in percentage rental income (over 2.5 times the comparable period in 2019). Traffic rebounded to approximately 99% of 2019 levels, leading to increased sales. The company increased its full-year guidance for core FFO per share to a range of $1.67 to $1.71 to reflect the improved operating environment. This guidance assumes potential bankruptcies and brandwide restructurings of up to 50,000 square feet for the remainder of the year. Tanger's financial position remains strong with low leverage (5.3x net debt to adjusted EBITDA) and ample liquidity, including $520 million of borrowing capacity.
