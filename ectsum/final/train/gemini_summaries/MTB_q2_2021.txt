M&T reported strong financial results for the second quarter, with GAAP earnings per share reaching $3.41 and net income climbing to $458 million. Net interest income decreased due to reduced PPP-related income, while the net interest margin declined to 2.77%. Nonaccrual and criticized loans increased slightly, reflecting the uneven recovery in sectors like hospitality and healthcare. Despite these increases, loss emergence remains low, and the allowance for credit losses continues to align with ultimate loss expectations. The company's balance sheet further strengthened, with capital and liquidity growing from already elevated levels. The merger with People's United is progressing as planned, and the company expects to close and integrate the acquisition in the fourth quarter. Looking ahead, M&T anticipates continued strong customer activity, but warns that excess liquidity and high customer deposits may continue to suppress loan growth and net interest income. Expenses are expected to increase somewhat in the second half due to factors such as reopening costs and merger-related expenses. Despite these challenges, the company remains optimistic about the overall economic outlook and its long-term prospects.
