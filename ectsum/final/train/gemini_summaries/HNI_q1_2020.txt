HNI Corporation reported strong first quarter operating results, despite challenges due to COVID-19. The company has implemented measures such as temporary salary reductions, furloughs, and capital expenditure cuts to manage costs and maintain financial flexibility. Liquidity remains strong with $350 million at quarter end, and HNI anticipates $60-$65 million in cost improvements for 2020. Scenario analysis indicates HNI can manage a 25% decline in earnings, generate free cash flow, and remain within debt covenants. Stress testing shows the company can support $270 million in debt with zero cash earnings due to substantial depreciation and amortization. Despite near-term uncertainty, HNI remains focused on customer experience, simplifying buying processes, and leveraging its lean heritage. Strategic priorities will drive significant improvements over the long term.
