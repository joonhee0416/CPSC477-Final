**Summary:**

Eversource reaffirms its long-term earnings growth projection in the 5%-7% range. However, the company revised its 2021 guidance to the lower end of $3.81-$3.93 per share, considering customer credits. Eversource faces regulatory challenges in Connecticut, including a potential 90 basis point reduction in authorized ROE for CL&P. Despite the challenges, the company remains committed to its core regulated business and clean energy initiatives, including offshore wind expansion in Massachusetts. Eversource budgeted approximately $500 million for solar generation from 2022 to 2025 and expects the Massachusetts offshore wind expansion to help it maintain its leadership in the sector. The company also plans to acquire the Connecticut Water Service for $1.1 billion, which is expected to be accretive in 2022.
