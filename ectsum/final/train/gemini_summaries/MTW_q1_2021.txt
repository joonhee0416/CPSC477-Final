The first quarter saw a strong performance despite supply chain and pandemic challenges, exceeding expectations for adjusted EBITDA and cash flow. Order volume increased 26% year-over-year, with a backlog of $663 million. European tower crane demand was particularly strong due to government incentives, dealer orders, and advance orders anticipating price increases. However, the mobile crane business in Europe was more cautious. The Middle East, Asia Pacific, and North America experienced solid bookings. While North American order growth was positive, the outlook remains measured due to cautious investment by rental houses, oil companies, and depressed used equipment prices. The company expects higher costs for steel, logistics, and transportation, as well as supply chain complications due to semiconductor shortages. Despite these headwinds, they anticipate momentum building in the global crane market and are pursuing four strategic initiatives for growth: a European tower crane rental fleet expansion, a Chinese tower crane business expansion, investments in all-terrain cranes, and the development of Grove Connect remote diagnostic technology. The company has provided adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2021 of $90-$105 million.
