Sales revenue soared 30% to a record $706 million, driven by favorable pricing across both ADS and Infiltrator segments. While volume declined slightly in some areas, Infiltrator sales surged 38%. The company's international sales also witnessed a 29% increase. Backlog and order pace remained strong, supporting updated sales targets of $2.55 billion to $2.65 billion (growth of 29% to 34%). Despite inflationary pressures, adjusted EBITDA decreased 5% due to labor shortages and transportation challenges. However, Infiltrator's performance mitigated the impact on profitability. The company has implemented price increases to address cost pressures, and self-help programs have improved production rates. Working capital increased as the company purchased raw materials at higher costs, but progress is being made on inventory management. Capital allocation is prioritized towards organic growth initiatives, with $130 million to $150 million earmarked for capital expenditures. M&A remains a focus, and the company remains committed to financial flexibility and shareholder returns.
