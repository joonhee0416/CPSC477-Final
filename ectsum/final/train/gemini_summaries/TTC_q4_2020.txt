The Toro Company reported strong results for fiscal 2020, driven by growth in the Professional segment (3% net sales increase and 12% earnings gain) and a record performance in the Residential segment (24% net sales increase and 75% earnings gain). Key factors driving this success were increased demand for walk power mowers and zero-turn riding mowers in the Residential segment and growth in landscape contractor, snow and ice management, and other product categories in the Professional segment. Despite COVID-19 challenges, gross margin increased 3.3% in Q4 and 1.8% for the full year. The company's liquidity is strong with $1.1 billion cash and cash equivalents, no significant debt maturities until April 2022, and plans to resume share repurchases in fiscal 2021. For fiscal 2021, Toro projects sales growth of 6-8%, expects adjusted operating earnings as a percent of net sales to improve thanks to continued productivity and synergy benefits, and anticipates adjusted earnings per share of $3.35 to $3.45.
