Hilltop Securities also delivered a pre-tax profit of $28 million. Notably, Hilltop took significant steps to enhance its liquidity position, ending the period with $6.6 billion of cash, securities, and secured borrowing capacity. The company also booked over 2,800 PPP loans totaling $672 million and built its loan reserve to reflect the economic outlook. Despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Hilltop remains focused on delivering prudent growth, executing platform initiatives, and maintaining a moderate risk profile.
