Despite supply chain disruptions and rising material costs, the company saw a 22% increase in sales to $454 million and a 5% increase in earnings per share to $0.58. Material cost increases negatively impacted gross margin rates, which were partially offset by pricing and factory performance. The contractor segment continued to perform well, with record sales and 30% revenue growth. The industrial segment saw growth in all regions and product categories. The process segment also grew, benefiting from improving end-market conditions. The company expects a solid second quarter but anticipates tougher comparisons in the second half. It will continue to invest in growth strategies and anticipates a 2% tailwind from currency translation and a 5% impact on earnings for the full year.
