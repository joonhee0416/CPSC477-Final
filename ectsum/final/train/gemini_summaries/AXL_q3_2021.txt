Despite supply chain challenges impacting production, AAM delivered solid performance in Q3 2021, with sales of $1.21 billion, down 14% year-over-year due to a $245 million semiconductor supply chain disruption. Adjusted EBITDA was $183 million, with margins approximating 19% excluding metal markets and currency impacts. The earnings per share were $0.15, down from $1.15 in Q3 2020. AAM secured an initial platform business award with REE to supply high-performance electric drive units for their REEcorner technology. The company expects adjusted EBITDA for 2021 to be in the range of $830 million to $850 million and adjusted free cash flow of approximately $400 million. As the supply chain issues resolve, AAM anticipates an extended recovery to meet customer demand and replenish inventories, benefiting from the strong demand in light trucks, SUVs, and the replenishment of crossover vehicles.
