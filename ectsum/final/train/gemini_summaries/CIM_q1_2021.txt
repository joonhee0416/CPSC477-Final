Chimera reported solid first-quarter earnings with a GAAP net income of $139 million and a core net income of $87 million. The housing market's strength drove the company's performance, with home prices rising 11.2% year-over-year and mortgage rates remaining low. Chimera optimized its portfolio by exercising call rights on $4.1 billion of residential mortgage loans, resulting in cost savings of up to 300 basis points. The company issued new securitizations with a weighted average cost of 2.04% and 2.24%, further reducing its cost of financing. Chimera's securitized debt represents nearly 70% of its liability structure and is expected to provide durable portfolio income. The company also purchased high-yielding business purpose loans and proactively managed its agency CMBS portfolio. As the housing market remains strong, Chimera is well-positioned to grow its portfolio and generate additional income opportunities.
