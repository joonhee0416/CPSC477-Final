MarineMax's record-breaking second quarter exceeded expectations with a 45% same-store sales growth, driving a sevenfold increase in earnings per share. This growth was primarily fueled by new unit sales, laying the groundwork for future revenue. The company's strategic diversification, technology investments, and strong relationships with manufacturers have enabled it to gain market share. Despite low inventory levels, MarineMax's strong sales growth indicates its ability to adapt to changing market conditions. The industry outlook remains positive, with expectations for high single-digit retail unit growth in 2021. As a result, MarineMax has raised its annual same-store sales growth guidance to the high teens and its earnings per share guidance to $5.50-$5.65. The company remains optimistic with strong April sales growth and a record-high backlog, indicating continued momentum in the upcoming quarters and into fiscal 2022.
