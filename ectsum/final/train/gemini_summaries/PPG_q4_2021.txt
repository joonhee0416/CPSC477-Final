PPG recorded $4.2 billion in net sales for Q4 2021, setting a record high, and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.26. Despite strong sales performance, adjusted earnings fell 10% short of guidance due to significant COVID-related challenges, including staffing shortages and supply chain disruptions. The company's PPG-Comex business achieved 10% organic sales growth for the year, while the protective and marine business and automotive refinish segment also posted strong results. However, raw material cost inflation of about 30% and operational inefficiencies led to lower segment earnings. Despite headwinds, PPG maintained a strong balance sheet and reduced its net debt by $350 million. Looking ahead, demand remains robust, but supply chain disruptions are expected to continue into Q1 2022. The company plans to implement further price increases and manage costs aggressively. Optimism remains high with the expectation of future earnings growth driven by recovery in key businesses, normalized raw material costs, and above-market organic growth through its distribution network and advantaged brands. PPG projects earnings per share to reach at least $9 in 2023.
