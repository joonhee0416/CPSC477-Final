Sun's Q1 earnings exceeded expectations, with core FFO per share of $1.26 surpassing guidance and prompting a $0.13 upward revision in annual guidance to a range of $5.92 to $6.08. The RV business showed resilience despite pandemic-related closures, with forward bookings exceeding 2020 and 2019 levels. Same community NOI growth reached 2.7%, and total portfolio occupancy reached 97.3%. The manufactured housing business continues to benefit from strong demand, with applications increasing 21% year-over-year. The marina business is performing ahead of underwriting, with increased boat sales driving demand for slips and moorings. Sun invested $183 million in acquisitions during the quarter and executed a $1.1 billion equity raise to fund future growth. The company is optimistic about the underlying trends observed across all business lines and anticipates accelerated growth in RV and marina businesses as vaccination rates increase.
