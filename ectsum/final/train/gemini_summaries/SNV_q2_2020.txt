Synovus reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.23 for the second quarter of 2020, up from $0.21 in the previous quarter but down from $1 a year ago. Loan balances increased by 4.3% sequentially to $39.91 billion, primarily driven by $2.7 billion in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans. Total deposits grew by 11% to $63.47 billion, with growth split between DDA and interest-bearing core deposits. Net interest income increased slightly to $377 million, but the net interest margin declined 24 basis points to 3.13%. Adjusted non-interest revenue was higher than expected at $95 million, largely due to outperformance in mortgage. Adjusted non-interest expense totaled $276 million, up $5 million from the previous quarter. The provision for credit losses was $142 million, resulting in an allowance for credit losses ratio of 1.74%, excluding PPP balances. CET1 and total risk-based capital ratios increased to 8.90% and 12.70%, respectively. As of July 14th, 2.3% of the total loan portfolio was in a 90-day deferral status, with the potential to increase to 3-5% this quarter. Synovus believes its strong deposit base and focus on expense management will help it navigate the ongoing economic challenges. The bank is also implementing its "Synovus Forward" initiative to drive efficiencies and revenue growth.
