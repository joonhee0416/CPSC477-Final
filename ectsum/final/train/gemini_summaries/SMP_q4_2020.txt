SMP experienced a strong end to 2020 with record sales in both Engine Management and Temperature Controls, resulting in a 17% increase in total sales. Despite the pandemic's initial impact, the company made a significant recovery, ending the year nearly flat compared to 2019. However, the recent loss of a major customer in Engine Management will impact revenue in 2021. SMP remains focused on replacing the lost volume while exploring growth opportunities in areas such as alternative energy vehicle components and heavy-duty aftermarket expansion. Positive industry trends, such as an aging vehicle fleet and low gas prices, support the company's outlook for growth. Strong customer sell-through from the latter half of 2020 has continued into 2021, indicating continued demand for SMP's products.
