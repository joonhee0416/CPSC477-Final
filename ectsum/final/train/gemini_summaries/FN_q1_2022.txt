In Q1'22, the company surpassed revenue and earnings expectations, with revenue reaching $543.3 million, a 24% YoY increase, and non-GAAP net income per share being $1.45, exceeding guidance. Optical communications notably contributed with a 24% YoY revenue growth, driven by telecom and datacom demand. Despite component supply constraints, the impact was lower than anticipated, resulting in record optical communications revenue. Automotive revenue declined slightly due to supply chain issues. The company anticipates continued demand strength in Q2 and expects revenue between $540 million and $560 million, with non-GAAP net income per diluted share projected between $1.42 and $1.49. The company is on track to complete construction of its second building in Chonburi, expanding manufacturing capacity, as demand is expected to remain strong.
