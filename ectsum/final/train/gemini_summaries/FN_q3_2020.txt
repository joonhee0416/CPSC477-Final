In the third quarter, despite facing challenges from COVID-19, the company maintained operations at 100% capacity, resulting in $411 million in revenue and non-GAAP net income per share of $0.92. Optical communications revenue declined 4% sequentially but increased 3.5% year-over-year, driven by growth in silicon photonics and QSFP transceivers. Non-optical communications revenue remained flat. Gross margin was 11.2%, below the target range due to pandemic-related expenses. The company continued its share repurchase program, buying back 355,000 shares for $20.7 million. Despite revenue headwinds, the company maintains optimism about long-term growth trends and expects fourth-quarter revenue to be between $370 million and $400 million, with non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.80 to $0.92.
