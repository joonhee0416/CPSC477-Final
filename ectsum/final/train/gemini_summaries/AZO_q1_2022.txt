AutoZone experienced strong performance in Q1, with domestic same-store sales increasing by an impressive 13.6%. This led to a 38.1% surge in earnings per share to $25.69, a notable increase from the previous year. Commercial sales reached a record $900 million and delivered a 29% growth, while DIY retail sales grew by 9%. The company attributes this growth to various initiatives, including improved store availability, hub and mega hub coverage, and strong customer service. Despite inflationary pressures, AutoZone has been able to offset costs through pricing actions and maintained gross margins. Operating expenses increased by 10.4%, mainly due to customer service investments and technology upgrades. The company remains committed to its capital allocation strategy, having repurchased $900 million worth of shares during the quarter. AutoZone's long-term outlook remains positive, as it anticipates continued growth in both the retail and commercial sectors and plans to expand its supply chain and open more mega hubs throughout the fiscal year.
