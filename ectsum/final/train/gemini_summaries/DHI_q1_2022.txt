DR Horton's first quarter performance was impressive, with a 48% increase in earnings per share to $3.17, a 19% rise in revenues, and a 380 basis point improvement in pre-tax profit margin. The company's strong balance sheet and low leverage position it well to navigate changing economic conditions. Despite supply chain and labor challenges, DR Horton remains focused on expanding market share and expects double-digit volume growth in 2022. Its homes and inventory increased 30% year-over-year, with only 1,000 unsold completed homes nationwide. While mortgage rates have risen, housing demand remains robust, and the company continues to generate strong cash flows. DR Horton remains committed to returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and it anticipates reducing its outstanding share count by approximately 2% at the end of fiscal 2022.
