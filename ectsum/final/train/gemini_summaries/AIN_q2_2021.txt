Albany International reported strong Q2 results with record-breaking free cash flow, driven by excellence in operations and customer service. Despite supply chain challenges and inflation, the company achieved near-record profitability with gross margins of 43% and operating margins of 21%. Revenue grew year-over-year to $235 million, supported by Engineered Composites (AEC) and Machine Clothing (MC) segments. In AEC, domestic airline travel recovery boosted LEAP engine demand, and the company is preparing for increased production. It also announced a collaboration with Spirit AeroSystems to develop 3D-woven composite applications for hypersonic vehicles. MC continues to benefit from strong demand in packaging and tissue end markets, particularly with online shopping growth. The segment raised its revenue guidance to $585-600 million for the year. Overall, Albany remains optimistic with a strong balance sheet and plans to continue investing in R&D and technology across both segments to drive future growth.
