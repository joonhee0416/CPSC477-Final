In the fourth quarter of 2020, ManpowerGroup reported a revenue of $5.1 billion, down 6% year-over-year but indicating a steady recovery trend from the 14% decline in the third quarter. Excluding restructuring charges, operating profit was $151 million, a 24% decrease on a constant currency basis. Earnings per diluted share were $1.48, excluding restructuring charges, reflecting a 39% decrease in constant currency. For the full year, reported earnings per share were $0.41, while excluding restructuring charges and special items, earnings per share were $3.67, representing a 53% constant currency decline. Despite challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic, the company remained committed to its digitization, diversification, and innovation strategy, reducing operational SG&A expenses to offset gross profit declines. ManpowerGroup's Talent Solutions business line experienced positive trends, particularly in RPO and MSP services, with organic gross profit growth in the quarter. The company anticipates continued improvement in rate of revenue decline to the very low single digits for the first quarter of 2021, with ongoing improvement in operating profit margins.
