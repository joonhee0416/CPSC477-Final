PCA reported a surge in net income to $207 million for Q2 2021, a 56% increase from the previous year, primarily driven by higher prices and mix in the Packaging segment. Packaging EBITDA reached $409 million with a margin of 24%, surpassing last year's $313 million and 22% margin. Despite inflationary pressures in labor, materials, and freight, PCA implemented price increases that contributed to higher revenue. The Paper segment also saw a slight increase in EBITDA, driven by volume growth. Looking ahead, the company anticipates continued strong demand in the Packaging segment and expects third-quarter earnings of $2.37 per share, considering factors such as inflation and maintenance outages. PCA remains focused on cost-reduction initiatives through efficiency improvements and capital spending to offset rising costs and enhance margins.
