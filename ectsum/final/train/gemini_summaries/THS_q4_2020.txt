TreeHouse Foods delivered strong financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2020, exceeding guidance on revenue and earnings per share. The company achieved 3.3% organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter, with snacking and beverages reporting strong organic growth of 8.1%. For the full year, organic net sales growth was 2.7%, driven by unmeasured channels, which include fast-growing food retailers with a heavy emphasis on private label. TreeHouse successfully completed the acquisition of Riviana, adding $170-180 million in revenue and $25-30 million in EBITDA, while integrating the business on track and uncovering further value creation opportunities. The company believes that private label remains a significant growth opportunity, particularly in categories where it has established depth and operating capabilities. TreeHouse plans to capitalize on its position as a leader in private label by focusing on growth engines, which represent 40% of net sales and offer opportunities for low to mid-single-digit top-line growth with improved margins. The company also remains committed to cash engines, which represent another 40% of sales and provide strong cash flow. Financial flexibility will be deployed through disciplined M&A and share buybacks to maximize shareholder value while maintaining balance sheet strength. TreeHouse is confident in delivering on its strategic growth algorithm, which includes organic growth, accretive M&A, and productivity enhancements, aiming for 10% adjusted earnings per share growth annually.
