DaVita reported strong Q2 performance with 6% year-over-year growth in adjusted operating income and 35% growth in earnings per share, despite a $35 million COVID headwind. They achieved this through strong RPT performance and cost discipline. The company highlighted its progress in integrated kidney care, with 10% of US dialysis patients now in value-based care arrangements and an expectation to double this business in 2022. However, this growth is projected to result in a $50 million operating loss in 2022 before significant financial improvement is expected in 2023. DaVita remains cautiously optimistic about post-pandemic growth and expects to return to pre-pandemic treatment growth levels. The company increased its guidance ranges for 2021, excluding the potential impact of a significant fourth COVID surge. However, headwinds in the second half of the year include increased COVID-related costs and losses in the ancillary segment due to new value-based care arrangements. Despite these challenges, DaVita believes that its integrated care business has the potential to drive significant operating income growth in the future.
