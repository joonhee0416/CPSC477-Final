In Q4 2020, Boston Beer Company experienced a 26% increase in depletions, driven by strong growth in its Truly Hard Seltzer and Twisted Tea brands. The Truly brand, particularly Truly Lemonade Hard Seltzer, has continued to lead the category with triple-digit volume growth in 2020 and an increase in market share. Despite challenges faced by its Samuel Adams, Angry Orchard, and Dogfish Head brands due to on-premise closures, the company remains positive about their long-term growth potential. Boston Beer is investing heavily to expand its capacity and improve its supply chain efficiency in anticipation of continued growth in the hard seltzer category. Looking ahead, the company projects earnings per diluted share of $20 to $24 for 2021, targeting shipment and depletion increases of 35% to 45% and national price increases of 1% to 2%. Gross margins are expected to be between 45% and 47%, lower than previous estimates, due to higher usage of third-party breweries. Despite increased investments in marketing and selling expenses, the company anticipates leveraging operating expenses to support long-term profitable growth.
