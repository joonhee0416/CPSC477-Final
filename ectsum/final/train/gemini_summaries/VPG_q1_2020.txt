Despite challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, VPG delivered revenues of $67.7 million in Q1 2020 with an adjusted EPS of $0.29. Foreign exchange negatively impacted revenues by $600,000. Gross margin improved from 36.8% in Q4 2019 to 37.8% in Q1 2020. VPG experienced operational disruptions at their China and India facilities due to government-imposed restrictions, but as of May 5, 2020, all facilities except the one in India are fully operational. The company has received approval to resume partial operations at its India facility. VPG's diverse markets have helped mitigate the impact of weaker end markets during this period. Looking ahead to Q2 2020, VPG expects revenues between $56 million and $62 million. The company's strong financial position and strategic initiatives provide confidence in its ability to navigate current challenges and accelerate performance as conditions normalize.
