Whitestone's third quarter financials showcased continued growth with a 9% revenue increase to $32.4 million and a $0.25 per share FFO. Strong leasing activity, including 38 new leases totaling 90,000 square feet, drove this growth. Same-store NOI increased by 7% annually, supported by occupancy gains and an increase in annual base rent per square foot. The company's long-term deleveraging goal is progressing, with debt to EBITDA improving to 8.1 times from 9.4 times a year ago. Whitestone also reactivated its external growth plan with the acquisition of Lakeside Market, bringing its leased space to 4.6 million square feet. The company emphasized its high tenant retention rate, strong leasing spreads, and focus on smaller entrepreneurial tenants, which have contributed to its consistent performance. Additionally, the dividend yield remains at a 4.3% premium with an exceptionally strong payout ratio to FFO core of 42%.
