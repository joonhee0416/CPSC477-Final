Edison International reported core earnings per share of $0.94 for Q2 2021, a decrease of $0.06 from the same period last year, with revenue rising by $0.10 due to CPUC and FERC-related activities. The 2021 General Rate Case remains unresolved, with a proposed decision recommending lower base rate revenue requirements than requested. Key points include:

- SCE's 2021 wildfire mitigation plan shows promising results, with circuits with covered conductors experiencing 69% fewer faults and vegetation clearance reducing tree-related faults by 50%.
- The utility has prioritized covered conductor deployment and Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS) to mitigate wildfire risk, with 540 circuit miles of covered conductor installed year-to-date.
- SCE supports critical safety and reliability investments and emphasizes that underfunding wildfire mitigation measures could lead to greater economic pain and loss of life.
- SCE has invested heavily in vehicle electrification, with the Charge Ready 2 program supporting the installation of 38,000 new electric car chargers.
- The company's commitment to sustainability aligns with capital investment plans to address climate change impacts and enhance grid resilience.
