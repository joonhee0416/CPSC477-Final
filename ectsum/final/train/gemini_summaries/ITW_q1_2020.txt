Despite a 9% revenue decline in Q1 2020, ITW's operating margin remained stable at 23.6%, largely due to enterprise initiatives. The company generated $554 million in free cash flow and a 27% after-tax return on invested capital. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, ITW has prioritized protecting employee health, serving customers with excellence, maintaining financial strength, and leveraging its strengths to participate in the recovery. The company's decentralized operating structure, entrepreneurial culture, and robust free cash flow position it to withstand challenges and take advantage of opportunities. Despite an estimated 30-40% revenue decline in Q2, ITW expects to maintain profitability, generate strong free cash flow, and end the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash on hand. The company's dividend remains a critical component of its shareholder return model, and it does not anticipate any reduction. ITW has ample balance sheet capacity and is open to strategic opportunities that may arise during the pandemic. While the company will manage discretionary expenses prudently, it will avoid cutting muscle prematurely and remain invested in capturing incremental demand. ITW remains committed to its long-term strategic priorities and is confident in its ability to navigate the challenges and emerge stronger.
