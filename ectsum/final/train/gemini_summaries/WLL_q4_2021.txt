Whiting reported strong fourth-quarter results, with net income on a GAAP basis of $292 million ($7.34 per diluted share) and adjusted net income of $168 million ($4.23 per diluted share). Adjusted EBITDAX increased to $226 million from $201 million in the previous quarter, driven by higher commodity prices and increased oil production. For 2022, Whiting expects a slightly higher activity level, anticipating increased non-operated activity and inflationary pressures. The company has already secured big-ticket items for the first half of 2022, but remains less protected in the latter half. In February, Whiting acquired non-operated assets in its Sanish Field, which it believes will add significant shareholder value. The company's current hedges, based on $70 WTI and $4 gas prices, project over $900 million in EBITDA and $500 million in adjusted free cash flow, enabling continued capital returns and acquisition opportunities.
