Omega Senior Living reported a strong first quarter with an adjusted FFO of $0.85 per share, maintaining their quarterly dividend. Despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, they collected virtually all contractual rents and have strengthened their financial position with record low liquidity and debt maturity. The vaccination rollout has led to a significant improvement in vaccination rates, with 81% of residents and 49% of staff vaccinated as of April 30. Occupancy rates have stabilized and are showing signs of recovery, reaching 73.4% in April. However, industry recovery is dependent on occupancy returning to pre-pandemic levels. Omega remains concerned about potential cash flow issues and financial stress for some providers, emphasizing the need for continued government support. They have made strategic investments in senior housing, including a high-rise memory care facility in Manhattan, and continue to work with operators on reinvestment in existing assets.
