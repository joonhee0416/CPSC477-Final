Despite a challenging 2020, MSA achieved record high revenue of $388 million in Q4, driven by strength in fire service and air purifying respirators. Despite revenue challenges in certain areas, adjusted operating margin reached 18%. Key areas supporting management's confidence for the future include a strong innovation engine, continuous improvement initiatives, and strategic acquisitions. MSA's R&D pipeline focuses on solving customer challenges, as exemplified by the Advantage 290 respirator and the LUNAR system for firefighters. The company continues to execute its international playbook, with a 270-basis-point improvement in operating margin in the International segment in 2020. MSA recently acquired Bristol Uniforms, enhancing its position in firefighter turnout gear. While the company approaches the first half of 2021 cautiously due to external factors, it anticipates a stronger second half and is committed to executing its strategy, growing market share, improving margins, and driving strong cash flow performance.
