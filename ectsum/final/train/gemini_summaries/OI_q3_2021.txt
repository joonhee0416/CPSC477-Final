O-I Glass reported third-quarter adjusted earnings of $0.58 per share, exceeding guidance despite macro challenges. Despite a dip in shipments due to supply chain issues, production levels rebounded, and revenue growth was driven by price increases and revenue optimization. The company's ongoing transformation, including its MAGMA technology, is setting the path for profitable growth. O-I has increased its full-year earnings outlook to $1.77-$1.82 per share and expects at least $260 million in free cash flow. Margin expansion initiatives, MAGMA advancements, and portfolio optimization efforts are making O-I a more agile and resilient organization, well-positioned for future success. Fourth-quarter earnings are expected to approximate $0.30-$0.35 per share, reflecting cost inflation that will be addressed by annual price increases in early 2022.
