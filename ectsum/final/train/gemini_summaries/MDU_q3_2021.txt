Despite challenges in the construction sector, MDU Resources reported third-quarter earnings of $0.68 per share, slightly lower than the $0.76 per share earned in the same quarter of 2020. Construction Services experienced a decline in earnings attributed to a $5.5 million after-tax adjustment on a construction contract and higher employee costs due to labor shortages. Construction Materials also saw a decrease in earnings due to decreased margins and lower contracting revenues. In contrast, the Regulated Energy Delivery business reported net income of $5.2 million, a significant improvement from the prior year's loss. The strong performance of the utility operations helped offset headwinds in the construction businesses. MDU Resources has adjusted its full-year earnings per share guidance to a range of $1.90 to $2.05 due to the weaker-than-expected construction results. The company also noted the potential for growth from the allocation of American Rescue Plan Act Funds and a federal infrastructure plan.
