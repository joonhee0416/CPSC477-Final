Assured Guaranty reported strong third-quarter results, with $96 million in new business production, the second-highest quarterly production in a decade. Year-to-date PVP totaled $263 million, on pace with last year's production. Shareholders' equity, adjusted operating shareholders' equity, and adjusted book value all reached record highs. Year-to-date earned adjusted operating income of $197 million was comparable to last year's first three quarters despite a $138 million after-tax loss on debt extinguishment. This loss resulted from the early redemption of certain senior notes, which will reduce next year's debt service by $5.2 million. Total municipal bond issuance remained strong in Q3, with new par issue exceeding the previous year's record. Insurance penetration reached its highest level for a third quarter in any nine-month period in over a decade, reaching 8.5% for both Q3 and the nine-month period. Assured Guaranty continues to lead the municipal bond insurance industry with a market share of almost two-thirds of insured par sold in the primary market in Q3. In the nine months to date, the company guaranteed more than 60% of insured new issue par sold this year, a significant increase over 2020 and 2019. The quality of the insured portfolio continues to improve, with the below-investment-grade portion declining to nearly 3% of net par exposure. Positive developments in Puerto Rico's debt restructuring efforts have been observed, with negotiated agreements applying to 95% of par exposures to Puerto Rico entities.
