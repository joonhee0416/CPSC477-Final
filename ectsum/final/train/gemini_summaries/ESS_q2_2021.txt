Essex reported strong Q2 results, surpassing initial expectations due to the faster-than-anticipated economic recovery from the pandemic. Net effective rents surged during the quarter and are now above pre-pandemic levels, with suburban markets leading the way. The company revised its 2021 net effective rent growth forecast to -0.9%, reflecting an improvement from the -1.9% predicted earlier this year. Cash delinquencies remain elevated but are expected to return to normal levels as more workers enter the workforce and eviction protections expire. The reopening of West Coast economies has led to increased demand for housing, driving strong rent growth, particularly in CBDs that were hardest hit during the pandemic. The company also highlighted positive trends in office development activity, which indicates future job growth and increased housing demand. Essex increased its full-year core FFO guidance by $0.09 per share, reflecting stronger operating results, partially offset by the impact of early redemptions of preferred equity investments.
