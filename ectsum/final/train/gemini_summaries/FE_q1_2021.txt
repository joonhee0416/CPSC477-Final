FirstEnergy reported first quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $0.62 per share and operating earnings of $0.69 per share, within the guidance range. Strong residential load, rate increases, and operational efficiency contributed to the results, partially offset by lost revenue from discontinued decoupling. The company is committed to enhancing compliance, with key actions including hiring a Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, strengthening governance, and improving internal controls. Despite investigations, FirstEnergy remains optimistic about its future, emphasizing its focus on safety, ethical behavior, and innovation. The company reaffirms its 2021 operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share and anticipates a $150-$200 million annual cash flow increase through 2023. FirstEnergy's progress in pension funding and debt reduction will support its goal of returning to investment grade credit ratings.
