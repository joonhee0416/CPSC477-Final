Colgate delivered strong Q1 results with organic sales growth of 5% driven by pricing and volume increases. Emerging markets performed well with double-digit organic growth, while developed markets were flat. Despite tough comparisons, Oral Care, Home Care, and Pet Nutrition saw growth. Premium innovation has been successful, contributing to gross margin expansion despite rising raw material costs. SG&A increased due to advertising and logistics, but excluding these factors, it declined year-over-year. On a base business basis, earnings per share grew 7%, with the company maintaining its guidance of mid-to-high single-digit growth for the year. Moving forward, priorities include driving broad-based growth through innovation and pricing, addressing cost inflation, and advancing key strategic initiatives in innovation, e-commerce, and sustainability while navigating the impact of the pandemic.
