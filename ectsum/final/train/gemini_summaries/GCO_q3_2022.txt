Genesco reported strong third-quarter performance, exceeding expectations and pre-pandemic levels. Total revenue grew 25% to $601 million, driven by store sales, which rose 30% year-over-year despite traffic still being below pre-pandemic levels. Journeys and Schuh, Genesco's retail concepts, led the growth, with sales exceeding pre-pandemic levels and digital sales continuing to increase. Branded concepts, including Johnston & Murphy (J&M) and Licensed Brands, also contributed to the positive results. J&M, in particular, saw progress in its turnaround strategy, with improved sales and the successful launch of new athletically inspired products. For the full year, Genesco expects adjusted earnings of $6.40 to $6.90 per share, representing an increase of approximately 45% over fiscal 2020. The company cited its ongoing footwear-focused strategy, improved gross margins, and cost management initiatives as key drivers of its success.
