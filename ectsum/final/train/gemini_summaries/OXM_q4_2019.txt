Oxford Industries' fiscal 2019 results reflect strong performance in direct businesses (70% of sales), with positive comparable sales in all quarters and a robust e-commerce growth of 10%. However, wholesale sales declined as department store sales represented only 11% of revenue. Amidst the COVID-19 outbreak, the company has prioritized employee well-being, store closures, and strengthening liquidity. To preserve cash, Oxford has drawn down $200 million from its credit facility and implemented measures such as furloughs and layoffs. Expense reductions are being made in areas like marketing and occupancy costs, while variable costs and capital expenditures are being reevaluated. To maintain financial stability, the board has reduced the quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share. Oxford remains confident in its ability to navigate the challenges posed by the pandemic by protecting its brands, preserving liquidity, and leveraging its digital capabilities to connect with customers.
