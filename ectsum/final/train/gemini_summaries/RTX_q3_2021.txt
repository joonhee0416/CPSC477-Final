Raytheon Technologies highlighted strong year-over-year and sequential growth, exceeding earnings expectations. The company is raising its adjusted earnings per share outlook to $4.10-$4.20, driven by strong cost control, synergy capture, and program execution. Free cash flow is also being revised higher to $5 billion. Despite challenges such as supply chain pressures and lower Boeing 787 build rates, the company remains cautiously optimistic about commercial and defense trends. Strategic acquisitions have been made to enhance capabilities in areas like aviation network services and space solutions, while non-core businesses have been divested. Raytheon Technologies continues to focus on driving operational excellence and margin expansion, while navigating potential headwinds from the COVID vaccine mandate and other factors.
