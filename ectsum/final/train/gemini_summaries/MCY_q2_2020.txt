In the second quarter, the company's net income reached $228.2 million ($4.12 per share), with $125.2 million in investment portfolio gains offsetting prior losses. Operating earnings improved to $1.86 per share due to a reduced combined ratio in the private passenger auto line. COVID-19's impact on driving resulted in lower frequency but increased severity and premium givebacks. Despite positive results in the private passenger auto line, unfavorable performances in other lines, including commercial auto and homeowners, were noted. To mitigate this, rate increases were implemented in California's homeowners line. New initiatives such as MercuryGO and commercial multi payroll programs were launched, showing encouraging initial adoption rates. The company's catastrophe reinsurance treaty was renewed with an increased limit and inclusion of wildfire coverage. Premiums written declined by 12.5%, primarily due to premium refunds and credits (excluding these, the decline was only 1.2%). Further premium returns of $22 million are expected in the third quarter, along with elevated expense ratios due to the disproportionate impact of premium declines on expenses.
