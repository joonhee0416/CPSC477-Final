Mercury's net income soared to $228.2 million ($4.12 per share) in Q2, boosted by $125.2 million in investment portfolio gains and an improved combined ratio (88.2% vs. 98.3% in Q2 2019). Notably, private passenger auto results improved due to reduced driving from COVID-19, offset by increased severity and premium refunds. Despite challenges in commercial auto, homeowners, and commercial multi-payer lines, the company introduced new products (MercuryGO personal auto usage-based insurance and commercial multi payroll) and renewed its catastrophe reinsurance treaty, increasing the limit from $600 million to $717 million. However, expenses rose to 27.2% due to premium refunds. Despite expected elevated expense ratios in Q3 from continued premium refunds, premiums written are projected to decline by only 1.2% excluding refunds.
