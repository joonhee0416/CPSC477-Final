During the second quarter, Acadia Realty Trust experienced positive performance, exceeding expectations with an FFO of $0.30 per share. Key drivers included new lease agreements in Chicago and New York City, resulting in earlier rent commencements and improved cash collections (96%). The company has increased its full-year FFO guidance to $1.14-$1.24 per share, anticipating continued growth in the second half of the year. Management highlighted a promising outlook with 5%-10% annual Core NOI growth projected through 2024, driven by lease-up, credit reserve stabilization, and contractual rent growth. Acadia Realty Trust closed on a $700 million credit facility, boosting its liquidity and enabling external growth opportunities. Fund V acquisitions are in progress, with a committed pipeline of $170 million, while Fund IV's Northeast grocery portfolio saw successful property sales. City Point in Downtown Brooklyn continues to attract interest, and refinancing plans are underway for the project. Overall, the company is optimistic about the future, citing the return of retailer demand, recovery in street retail, and opportunities in both the private and public capital markets.
