The company reported a strong second quarter with earnings per share of $1.09, benefiting from underwriting profits and favorable prior year loss reserves. Overall, top-line growth was 25%, resulting in an 84.8 combined ratio. The core business was supported by strong performance from Maui Jim and Prime. Despite a slight decline in investment income, operating cash flow remained robust. Premium growth was seen across all segments, with Property leading the way at 33% due to rate increases. Casualty and Surety also experienced growth, with underwriting profits and favorable reserve development. While COVID-related impacts continue to drive down the Casualty loss ratio, underlying performance has also improved. The company anticipates continued market momentum, driven by rate levels and market disruption, and remains focused on underwriting discipline and diversification to navigate these conditions.
