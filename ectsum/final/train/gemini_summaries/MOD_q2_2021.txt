Modine reported impressive Q2 results, exceeding expectations with a 40% adjusted EBITDA increase driven by improved market conditions and rigorous cost control. Their liquidity position has strengthened, resulting in a leverage ratio back to pre-pandemic levels and a $50 million share repurchase program. Additionally, the company has made significant progress in its strategic initiatives, including the announced sale of its liquid-cooled automotive business, which will free up capital for higher-return businesses, reduce liabilities, and improve cash flow. Modine's revenues were $460 million, with a 17.5% gross margin. Adjusted EBITDA of $55 million was $16 million higher than the prior year. Despite some uncertainty due to the pandemic, the company anticipates slightly positive cash flow for the remainder of the year, resulting in full-year free cash flow of $70 to $80 million. Modine's outlook for the full year includes net sales between 7% and 12% lower than the prior year, and adjusted EBITDA in a range of $155 to $165 million.
