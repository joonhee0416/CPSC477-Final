McCormick reported a strong first quarter with a 22% increase in total sales, driven by base business growth, new products, and acquisitions. Adjusted operating income rose 35%, expanding the operating margin by 160 basis points. Excluding special charges, transaction and integration expenses, adjusted earnings per share came in at $0.72 compared to $0.54 last year.

The company's Consumer segment performed exceptionally well, posting a 35% increase in sales, with Cholula's acquisition contributing 5%. Despite supply chain challenges, demand remained high as capacity expansion efforts started to yield results. In the Flavor Solutions segment, constant currency sales grew 3%, driven by the Americas and APZ regions.

McCormick's portfolio diversification and broad global reach enabled it to navigate market challenges posed by COVID-19. While the Americas and EMEA regions faced reduced demand from foodservice customers, APZ saw substantial growth due to increased at-home consumption and the recovery of the foodservice industry. The addition of Cholula and FONA further strengthened the company's product offerings and distribution reach.

For 2021, McCormick expects strong underlying base business performance and recent acquisitions to drive significant sales and operating income growth. Sales are projected to grow 6% to 8% in constant currency, with an adjusted operating income growth rate of 11% to 13% in constant currency. Adjusted earnings per share are forecast to increase by 5% to 7%, partially offset by increased COVID-19 costs, ERP investments, and a higher adjusted tax rate.
