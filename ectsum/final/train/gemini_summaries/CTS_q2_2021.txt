In Q2 2021, the company experienced a 54% growth in sales to $129.6 million, primarily due to strong demand. Despite ongoing supply constraints, the company maintained a solid gross margin of 36.8%, driven by improved product mix and effective cost management. EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share surged significantly, reaching 21.5% and $0.52, respectively. New business awards remained robust at $174 million, showcasing the company's diversification strategy across end markets. While revenues from Industrial, Medical, and Aerospace and Defense sectors contributed to overall growth, unfavorable raw material and freight costs impacted margins. The company is actively working with customers to mitigate these challenges. Restructuring efforts continue, with savings of $0.12 per share in earnings realized so far. Despite a non-cash pension settlement charge, the company maintained a solid financial position with an improved operating cash flow of $19 million. The company anticipates supply chain challenges to persist in the second half but remains optimistic about sustaining demand.
