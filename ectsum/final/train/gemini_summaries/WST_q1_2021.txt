West Pharmaceutical Services experienced a strong first quarter, driven by double-digit organic sales growth in both its base business and COVID-19-related products. The company's high-value components, including Westar, FluroTec, and Envision, fueled increased gross and operating margins, resulting in record earnings per share. West's global manufacturing network supported this growth, with capacity expansion underway to meet increasing demand. Operating cash flow surged by 55.3% to $88.7 million, while full-year 2021 net sales guidance was raised to a range of $2.63 billion to $2.655 billion. Adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance was also increased to a range of $6.95 to $7.10, incorporating an estimated $345 million in COVID incremental revenues and a $75 million benefit from foreign exchange rates. Despite continued capital investments, West's commitment to its strategic pillars of execution, innovation, and growth positions it for ongoing organic sales growth and margin expansion.
