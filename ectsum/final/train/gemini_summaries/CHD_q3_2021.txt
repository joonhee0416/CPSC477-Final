In Q3, Church & Dwight saw impressive 3.7% organic sales growth, exceeding its initial outlook, despite ongoing supply chain challenges. Five brands achieved double-digit consumption growth, including Vitafusion vitamins and Scent Boosters. However, shipments were constrained by supply issues, resulting in fill levels below normal. Online sales increased by 2% year-over-year and are expected to exceed 15% as a percentage of total sales for the full year. Inflation remains a major concern, with higher costs for raw materials, labor, and transportation compressing gross margin by 170 basis points. Despite these challenges, demand for vitamins, laundry additives, and cat litter remained elevated, while other categories experienced a recovery or decline from COVID highs. The company plans to expand capacity in 2022 and has authorized a $1 billion stock repurchase program. The full-year outlook includes 4% organic sales growth and 6% adjusted earnings per share growth, excluding items. In Q4, the company anticipates supply chain constraints to persist, with expected reported sales growth of approximately 3% and adjusted earnings per share of $0.61, representing a 15% increase compared to 2020.
