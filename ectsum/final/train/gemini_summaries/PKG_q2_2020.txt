PCA reported second quarter 2020 net income of $132 million, excluding special items, down from $194 million in Q2 2019. Excluding special items, the $0.66 per share decrease in earnings was driven primarily by lower prices and mix in packaging and paper segments, lower volumes in the paper segment, and higher depreciation expense. However, these were partially offset by lower operating costs. Packaging EBITDA, excluding special items, was $313 million with sales of $1.4 billion, resulting in a 22% margin, down from 23% in Q2 2019. Corrugated products demand was strong, especially in June, with shipments per day up 1.2% over last year's Q2. The paper segment recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $55.2 million due to the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on uncoated freesheet market conditions and cut size office paper product demand. Despite these challenges, PCA remains focused on financial and balance sheet strength, while expecting a stronger Q3 for corrugated products demand.
