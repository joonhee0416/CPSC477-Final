Chimera Investment Corporation saw notable progress in Q2 2021, refinancing $5.6 billion worth of loans through securitizations, resulting in a substantial 245 basis point reduction in overall cost of debt. Strong demand for single-family homes, record low inventory, and a 42% year-over-year decline in delinquency rates provide a favorable backdrop for Chimera's large portfolio of low-loan balance mortgages. The company's resecuritization efforts reduced the size and cost of outstanding credit financing, with the average cost of secured financing for residential credit assets dropping from 4.9% to 3.5%. Chimera generated a one-time income of $38 million through prepay penalties from its Agency CMBS and non-agency credit portfolio. With GAAP book value per share at $11.45, diluted GAAP net income per share at $0.60, and core earnings per share at $0.54, Chimera remains focused on long-term value creation and a sustainable dividend for shareholders.
