M&T reported a GAAP EPS of $3.33 for Q1 2021, down from $3.52 in Q4 2020 but up from $1.93 in Q1 2020. Net income was $447 million, down from $471 million in Q4 2020 but up from $269 million in Q1 2020. Net operating income was $457 million, compared to $473 million in Q4 2020 and $272 million in Q1 2020. Diluted net operating EPS were $3.41, compared to $3.54 in Q4 2020 and $1.95 in Q1 2020. Notable income drivers include a higher level of average interest-earning assets, primarily cash equivalents, which was partially offset by higher cash on deposit with the Federal Reserve. The allowance for credit losses declined by $100 million, due to a $25 million recapture of previous provisions for credit losses and net charge-offs of $75 million. The company's nonaccrual loans were $1.9 billion or 1.97% of loans at the end of March, slightly up from 1.92% at the end of December 2020. The company's outlook remains largely unchanged from the previous earnings call, with the improved credit outlook evidenced by the reserve release this quarter being the primary update.
