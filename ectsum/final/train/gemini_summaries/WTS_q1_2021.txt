The company reported a solid start to the year with an 8% increase in sales to $413 million despite supply chain challenges, supported by a freeze-related demand and an easier comparison in APMEA. Adjusted operating margin exceeded expectations due to cost actions and sales growth. Strong cash flow was generated, and a double-digit dividend increase was announced. Operationally, price increases have been implemented to offset rising commodity and logistics costs. Supply chain constraints have increased, leading to potential product availability issues. Investments for growth are planned, including increased spending on productivity projects. Forecasts for the second quarter remain strong, benefiting from the freeze impact and channel restocking. Adjusted operating margin is expected to range from 13.5% to 14.5% in Q2 despite incremental investment and cost headwinds. Full-year outlook has been increased with organic sales projected to range from 2% to 7% growth and consolidated adjusted operating margin expected to improve by 30 to 70 basis points. Despite concerns about supply chain issues and a potential slowdown in new construction, the company remains optimistic and is well-positioned financially and operationally.
