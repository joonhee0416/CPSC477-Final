Boston Beer Company experienced impressive 36% growth in depletions during Q3, largely driven by the popularity of Truly Hard Seltzer and Twisted Tea brands. Truly, in particular, continues to lead the hard seltzer market, despite increased competition, with its strong velocity and market share growth. To further strengthen its position, Boston Beer will introduce Truly Iced Tea Hard Seltzer, Truly Extra, and other innovations in 2021. Despite challenges faced by the Samuel Adams, Angry Orchard, and Dogfish Head brands due to COVID-19 and On-Premise closures, they have shown improvement in Off-Premise channels. The company expects overall volume growth rates between 35% and 45% in 2021, with projected increases in revenue per barrel and gross margins. Boston Beer also plans to increase investments in advertising, promotional, and selling expenses to support its brands and drive further growth.
