UniFirst's second-quarter revenues declined 3.2% year-over-year to $449.8 million, while fully diluted earnings per share decreased 6% to $1.71. Despite the impact of the pandemic and severe winter storms, the company saw solid results due to increased sales to existing customers. Positively, the company expects stronger activity in the second half of the year and improved retention rates over the first half of fiscal 2020. Optimism for economic recovery is balanced by uncertainty regarding the timeline and pace of the vaccine's impact on the economy. UniFirst's solid balance sheet and ongoing investments position it to navigate challenges while continuing to invest in growth. The company projects fiscal 2021 revenues between $1.793 billion and $1.803 billion and diluted earnings per share between $7.30 and $7.65, incorporating approximately $5 million in additional expenses related to its CRM system deployment.
