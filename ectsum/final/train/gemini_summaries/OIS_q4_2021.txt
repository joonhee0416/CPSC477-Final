Despite ongoing COVID-19 challenges, Oil States reported a 15% increase in Q4 2021 revenue, reaching $161 million. This growth was primarily driven by a 34% surge in Offshore/Manufactured Products revenues and a high order backlog. The company's EBITDA also saw a significant 57% increase to $13.4 million. Adjusted net loss per share was $0.14, excluding $11.5 million in non-cash charges. Looking ahead, Oil States anticipates a strong 2022 with revenue growth of over 20% and consolidated EBITDA in the range of $60-$70 million. The positive outlook is attributed to increasing frac spread counts, rising global oil demand, and an easing of pandemic-related disruptions. The company plans to invest $25 million in capital expenditures and focus on core areas of expertise, including perforating products and improved completion service offerings.
