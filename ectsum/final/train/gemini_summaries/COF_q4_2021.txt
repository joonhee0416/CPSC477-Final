In Q4 2021, Capital One reported net income of $2.4 billion ($5.41/share) for the quarter and $12.4 billion ($26.94/share) for the full year, with adjusted EPS of $27.11. Loans increased 6% QoQ and 10% YoY in domestic card, 7% YoY in commercial, and 1% YoY in consumer banking. The net interest margin rose 25 basis points QoQ to 6.6%, driven by balance sheet mix with higher card loans and lower cash and securities. Provision expense was $381 million, partially offset by allowance releases. Credit performance remained strong, with low charge-offs and delinquencies. Capital One's common equity Tier 1 capital ratio decreased to 13.1%, with net income offset by share repurchases and asset growth. The company sees growth opportunities in 2022 and plans to invest in marketing and technology to drive growth. However, rising tech talent costs may impact operating efficiency in the near term.
