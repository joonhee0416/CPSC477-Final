In Q1, the company reported revenue of $609 million, in line with expectations, and cash earnings per share of $2.82, slightly above guidance. Fuel prices were higher, but spreads were lower, resulting in no overall impact on the macro. Total revenue declined 8% year-over-year due to unfavorable Brazil FX and continued client volume softness. However, the company saw an uptick in volume in April, indicating an early sign of recovery. Retention remained strong at 93%, and credit losses were very low at $2 million. Sales performance was exceptional, growing 7% year-over-year, driven by record digital sales and 35,000 new business clients signed globally. For the full year 2021, revenue guidance remains unchanged at $2.65 billion. Q2 adjusted net income per diluted share is expected to be in the range of $2.80 to $3.00. The company anticipates continued volume growth throughout the year and is raising its adjusted net income per diluted share guidance $0.12 to $12.42.
