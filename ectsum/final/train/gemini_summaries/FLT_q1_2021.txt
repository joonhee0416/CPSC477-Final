FLEETCOR reported in-line financial performance in Q1, highlighted by an outstanding sales performance. Consolidated sales grew 7% year-over-year, the highest growth rate in several quarters. Credit losses were exceptionally low at $2 million, boosted by a $6 million recovery. Revenue guidance for the full year remains unchanged at $2.65 billion, but is supported by a significant sequential step-up in revenue in the forward quarters, with high teens growth in Q2, Q3, and Q4. Cash earnings per share guidance is elevated to $12.42, reflecting the Q1 beat. The acquisition of AFEX is nearing completion, with an expected closing in June, contributing approximately $12.60 to consolidated earnings per share. FLEETCOR is well-positioned for growth with a strong exit rate, digital initiatives, EV expansion, new market segment entries, brand consolidation, and ample capital for investments.
