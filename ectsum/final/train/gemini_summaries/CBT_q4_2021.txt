Cabot Corporation's fiscal 2021 marked a record year with adjusted earnings per share of $5.02 and segment EBIT of $550 million. The company aims to continue its growth trajectory in 2022, with a focus on strategic investments in high-growth areas such as battery materials, inkjet, and specialty carbons. Cabot expects adjusted earnings per share to range between $5.20 and $5.60 in fiscal 2022, with a step-up in Reinforcement Materials starting in the second quarter and improved results in all product lines in the Performance Chemicals segment. The company's cash flow will be directed towards funding growth investments, dividends, and opportunistic share repurchases. Positive demand and low inventories are driving a premium on local supply, leading to positive outcomes in tire customer agreements. With a strong balance sheet, a talented team, and a winning formula, Cabot is well-positioned for continued success and industry leadership.
