Paymentus had notable Q2 results, highlighted by the signings of Payveris and Finovera to enhance their Instant Payments Network (IPN). Payveris provides a modern money movement platform for financial institutions, while Finovera aggregates consumer bills. These acquisitions enable Paymentus to expand into the financial institution market, with Payveris serving over 265 institutions and Finovera offering a platform for bill aggregation. Despite a 5% decline in adjusted EBITDA to $8.3 million due to increased costs and investments, the company's adjusted EBITDA margin for Q2 was higher than anticipated. Revenue outlook for 2021 is projected to be between $378 million and $382 million, representing 25-27% growth. Contribution profit is expected to range from $152 million to $154 million, with an adjusted EBITDA of $25 million to $28 million. The company remains confident in its strategic progress and continues to execute on its three-horizon strategy while accelerating the expansion of its IPN ecosystem through Payveris and Finovera.
