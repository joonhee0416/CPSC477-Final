The bank's balance sheet remains healthy, with $2 billion growth in both loans and deposits.

The adoption of CECL accounting standards resulted in a $51.2 million provision for credit losses, reflecting the bank's conservatism and the impact of the economic outlook. Western Alliance remains strongly capitalized and liquid, with a CET1 ratio of 9.7% and access to over $10 billion in liquidity resources. The bank's experienced management team is confident in its ability to navigate the current crisis and emerge as a stronger institution.
