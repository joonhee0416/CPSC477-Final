AIG reported outstanding second quarter financial results, continuing the momentum from the first half of the year. General Insurance delivered exceptional performance, with strong top-line growth and significant improvement in combined ratios. Life and Retirement also performed well, driven by improved investment returns. The company made progress on the AIG 200 transformation, which remains on track to deliver $1 billion in cost savings by the end of 2022. AIG announced a strategic partnership with Blackstone, representing a milestone for the separation of Life and Retirement from AIG. The partnership strengthens Life and Retirement's distribution relationships and enhances its product offerings. AIG intends to pursue an IPO of Life and Retirement in the first quarter of 2022, leveraging the partnership with Blackstone. The company maintains a strong capital position and plans to delever and return capital to shareholders through debt reduction and share buybacks. The company remains confident in achieving a sub-90% accident year combined ratio ex CAT by the end of 2022. The partnership with Blackstone, coupled with the sale of certain Affordable Housing assets, provides flexibility and enables the IPO of Life and Retirement as a more developed independent company.
