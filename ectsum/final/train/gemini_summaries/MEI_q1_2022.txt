Methode delivered Q1 sales of $288 million, up 45% organically year-over-year, despite supply chain challenges and pandemic-related disruptions. EV sales grew to 16% of revenue, while Dabir faced pandemic-related headwinds. Methode secured solid awards in EV, cloud computing, and e-bike applications, totaling over $30 million in annual business. Despite reaffirming full-year guidance, the company anticipates challenges that could result in performance below the midpoint of the forecast. EBITDA rose to $48.5 million, aided by higher operating income. However, negative free cash flow of $6.2 million was driven by working capital changes and increased capital expenditures. Methode continues to allocate capital for organic growth, inorganic opportunities, and shareholder returns, including a $100 million share repurchase program and a 27% increase in dividends.
