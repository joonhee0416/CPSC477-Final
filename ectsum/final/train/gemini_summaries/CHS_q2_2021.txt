Despite pandemic challenges, the company reported a strong second quarter with an earnings per share of $0.21, the best since 2013. The turnaround plan drove sales growth of 54% across all brands, with Soma posting record sales and outperforming the market. The company's focus on product and marketing drove full-price selling and increased gross margin to 38.4%, its highest in 13 quarters. SG&A expenses improved, resulting in a 30.9% expense ratio. The company's digital transformation continues with increased digital sales and the success of tools like Style Connect and My Closet. Inventory management and strategic investments in product, marketing, and digital have positioned Soma for further growth and the potential to become a billion-dollar brand by 2025. Looking ahead, the company faces macro supply chain headwinds but expects sales and gross margin improvements in Q3 and FY2021, with consolidated year-over-year net sales improvement between 18-22% for Q3 and 32-35% for FY2021.
