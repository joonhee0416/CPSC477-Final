Kroger's third-quarter results showed positive identical sales without fuel, with a 3.1% increase, driven by strong digital sales that surged 103% over a two-year stack. The company's seamless ecosystem, including its new Boost by Kroger loyalty program, Kroger Delivery Now partnership, and strategic collaboration with Bed Bath & Beyond, supports its commitment to providing customers with flexibility and convenience. Despite higher costs and supply chain challenges, Kroger's cost management measures resulted in a decrease in operating, general, and administrative rates. The company's alternative profit business remains on track to deliver the high end of its expected range, and its fuel segment saw increased customer engagement and gallon growth. Kroger's financial strategy emphasizes strong cash flow and capital returns, as evidenced by its low debt-to-EBITDA ratio and share repurchases. The company continues to invest in its associates, with additional hourly rate increases and new labor agreements. For 2021, Kroger raised its guidance, expecting identical sales without fuel to fall between -0.4% and -0.2%, a two-year identical sales stack of 13.7% to 13.9%, and adjusted net earnings per diluted share in the range of $3.40 to $3.50. This updated guidance reflects Kroger's continued customer-centric focus, operational excellence, and commitment to long-term growth.
