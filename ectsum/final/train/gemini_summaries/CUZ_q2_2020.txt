Cousins Properties, a leading Sun Belt office REIT, delivered solid financial results in Q2 2020 despite pandemic-related headwinds. FFO was $0.66 per share, with 97% of total rents and 98% of office rents collected. Leasing activity remained muted, with 303,000 square feet leased with an average lease term of 7.6 years. However, second-generation cash rents grew by 20.6%, highlighting the quality of the portfolio and customer base. Physical occupancy remains low at 15%, impacting cash NOI, but is expected to see a modest increase after Labor Day. The company's fortress balance sheet and strong demand in Sun Belt markets position it well to weather the downturn and pursue strategic opportunities. Cousins believes that the pandemic has accelerated existing trends, such as migration to the Sun Belt, flight to quality, and increased importance of ESG. The company's portfolio is well-positioned to benefit from these trends, with 100% of properties located in amenity-rich Submarkets, 100% Class A, and an average building size of just 347,000 square feet.
