Assured Guaranty experienced significant success in 2021, achieving record shareholder value metrics. Adjusted operating income grew 84% to $470 million, resulting in adjusted operating income per share of $6.32. The company's insurance production loss mitigation and capital management strategies contributed to these strong results. Assured Guaranty generated $361 million in production volume, driven by strong demand in U.S. public finance, international infrastructure finance, and global structure finance markets. The U.S. public finance market saw record bond issuance, with Assured Guaranty capturing over 60% of insured par sold. The company also refinanced $600 million in debt, resulting in annual debt service savings of $5.2 million. Assured Guaranty made significant progress in its asset management business, launching new CLOs and healthcare funds. In the fourth quarter, adjusted operating income surged 134% year-over-year, primarily due to loss mitigation strategies for Puerto Rico exposures. The company repurchased $10.5 million shares in 2021, returning $562 million to shareholders. Assured Guaranty expects market conditions in 2022 to be different due to rising interest rates and economic factors, but believes it is well-positioned for success with its financial strength, diverse markets, and exceptional human capital.
