Carter's reported record earnings and sales in the second quarter, driven by structural changes that improved profitability. By reducing low-margin products, increasing higher-margin offerings, and optimizing inventory, Carter's achieved a significant increase in price realization. E-commerce continued to grow, representing 38% of retail sales and fueling store closures that have improved margins. The back-to-school season is expected to drive sales, and the company has expanded its marketing efforts to include a new OshKosh campaign and support the launch of Little Planet. International operations also performed well, with strong growth in Canada and opportunities in Mexico and Brazil. Despite supply chain disruptions and increased transportation costs, Carter's has raised its sales and earnings forecast for 2021, projecting record operating income and a 13.5% operating margin. The company's focus on profitability and margin improvement is expected to continue in the future.
