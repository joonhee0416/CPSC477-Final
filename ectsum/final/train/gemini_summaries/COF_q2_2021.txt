Capital One reported strong financial performance in Q2, with a net income of $3.5 billion ($7.62 EPS). Adjusted EPS was $7.71, excluding legal reserve builds. Revenue increased 4%, driven by strong Domestic Card purchase volume and the absence of a mark on the Snowflake investment. Loans held for investment grew $6.5 billion (3%). The allowance coverage ratio declined across all segments but remained above pre-pandemic levels due to an improving economic outlook and strong credit performance. The liquidity coverage ratio was 141%, well above the regulatory requirement. The net interest margin decreased 10 basis points to 5.89% due to lower yield in the card portfolio. Tier 1 capital ratio was 14.5%, down slightly from Q1. Consumer Banking experienced strong growth, driven by auto lending and retail deposits. The auto business saw a significant improvement in provision for credit losses, with a charge-off rate of negative 0.12%. Commercial Banking revenue increased from the prior-year quarter, driven by higher deposits. Capital One continues to invest in technology and return capital to shareholders.
