IDACORP reported $0.89 earnings per diluted share (EPS) in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of $0.15 from the same period last year. The company affirmed its full-year 2021 EPS guidance of $4.60 to $4.80, assuming normal weather and economic conditions. Strong customer growth in Idaho Power's service area, with a 3.5% annualized rate in March, and robust economic growth forecasts (8% in 2021, 8.1% in 2022, and 6.8% in 2023) support this guidance. Despite lower usage per commercial customer, higher residential usage and increased transmission wheeling revenues contributed to increased operating income. Operating and maintenance expenses decreased due to cloud-seeding timing, cost-saving measures, and the impact of exiting the Boardman plant. IDACORP's balance sheet remains strong with investment-grade credit ratings and ample liquidity. The company anticipates minimal pandemic impact and expects cash flows and regulatory adjustments to support its capital and operating needs.
