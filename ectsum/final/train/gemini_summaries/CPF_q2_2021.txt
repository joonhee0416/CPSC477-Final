Central Pacific Financial Corp. reported robust financial results in Q2, with record high pre-tax income, attributed to the strong economic recovery in Hawaii. Visitor arrivals have surged, reaching near pre-pandemic levels, and the state's unemployment rate is projected to decline significantly in 2022. The housing market remains robust, with median single-family home prices at $979,000. Despite the Delta variant surge, Hawaii's COVID-19 infection rates remain low, and nearly 60% of the population is fully vaccinated. Digital enhancements, including contactless debit cards, mobile deposit adoption, and online chat, continue to be key priorities. Credit quality remains solid, with classified assets declining and nonperforming assets remaining low. Central Pacific's ESG initiatives include the launch of the "We by Rising Tide" program, supporting women entrepreneurs, and ongoing investments in employee health and well-being. Net income for Q2 was $18.7 million or $0.66 per share, with a net interest margin of 3.16%. The company continues to repurchase shares and pay quarterly cash dividends. Central Pacific is committed to providing assistance to its workforce, customers, and the broader community during the economic recovery.
