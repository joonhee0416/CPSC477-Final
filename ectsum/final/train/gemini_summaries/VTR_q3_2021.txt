Ventas posted positive results in Q3 with a normalized FFO of $0.73 per share, driven by record occupancy growth in its same-store SHOP portfolio despite challenges in the broader environment. The occupancy increase represents a 750 basis point rise in US same-store SHOP portfolio occupancy since mid-March 2021 and a 600 basis point increase for the entire same-store SHOP portfolio over the same period. While labor cost pressures accelerated in September due to a tight labor market, Ventas anticipates improved pricing power and revenue increases in Q1 2022. Medical office and life science remain key growth drivers for the company, with $3.7 billion of investments announced or closed year-to-date. Ventas is optimistic about the future of senior housing and the external growth opportunities ahead, but acknowledges the ongoing uncertainty of the pandemic's impact on its business.
