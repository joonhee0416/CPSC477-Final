Cleveland-Cliffs reported record annual revenues, net income, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow in 2021, driven by acquisitions and industry consolidation. In Q4 2021, the company achieved its second-best quarterly adjusted EBITDA despite lower shipments due to seasonal factors and maintenance outages. Higher selling prices partially offset these volume and cost impacts. Cleveland-Cliffs has the largest fixed-price sales contract volume in the industry, which will drive higher average selling prices in 2022 compared to 2021, even with lower HRC futures prices. The company has refinanced or repaid debt significantly, reducing leverage and improving capital structure. Cleveland-Cliffs remains committed to ESG, including acquiring a major prime scrap processor, increasing HBI usage, and reducing coal and coke consumption. The company also plans to permanently close its Mountain State Carbon coke plant. While blast furnaces remain essential for automotive-grade steel production, Cleveland-Cliffs evaluates the potential cost-effectiveness of EAFs and may consider them as future replacements for blast furnace relines. The company expects strong demand in 2022, particularly from the automotive industry as chip shortages ease. Cleveland-Cliffs' unique position as a supplier of specialty electrical steels and its commitment to reducing emissions position it favorably in the transition to electric vehicles and infrastructure investment.
