Royal Caribbean Group has resumed operations and is optimistic about the future. Almost half of its fleet has restarted, and it aims to have 80% back in operation by year-end. Bookings are strong, especially for 2022, and they are at 2019 levels for the spring and summer of next year. The company's safety protocols, including a vaccination requirement, have been effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19, with isolated cases remaining contained. The booking environment is encouraging, and the company is seeing pent-up demand for cruises and onboard experiences. Additionally, the company is committed to sustainability, and it has made progress in reducing its environmental impact, including a 35% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Despite ongoing challenges, the company believes the flywheel is spinning at an accelerating pace and is optimistic about its future.
