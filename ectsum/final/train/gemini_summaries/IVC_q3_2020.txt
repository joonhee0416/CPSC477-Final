In Q3 2020, the company successfully offset lower sales through cost optimization, resulting in consecutive quarters of year-over-year adjusted EBITDA improvement. Net sales increased sequentially, primarily driven by Europe, and the pipeline of innovative clinical solutions is expected to drive incremental growth. Respiratory product demand remained high, while mobility and seating products showed signs of recovery. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, gross profit and operating income improved, and a significant majority of convertible notes were retired. The company increased its full-year guidance due to strong Q3 performance and visibility into Q4, including net sales of at least $840 million and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $28 to $32 million. The company remains optimistic about its transformation initiatives and sees opportunities to further optimize its capital structure.
