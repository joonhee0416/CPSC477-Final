Black Hills Corporation's first quarter earnings surpassed expectations despite the financial impact of Winter Storm Uri. The company's resilient infrastructure and power generation mix allowed it to avoid rolling blackouts during the storm, ensuring safe and reliable service to customers. Gross margins at gas utilities improved due to weather favorability and higher rates, while electric utility margins decreased slightly due to tax reform benefits passed on to customers. Total earnings were impacted by storm costs, which the company is mitigating through expense management and regulatory proceedings. Black Hills remains confident in its long-term growth targets, including 5-7% earnings growth from 2023-2025 and at least 5% annual dividend growth. The company plans to invest $3 billion in capital projects through 2025 and has secured $800 million in financing to bolster liquidity. Black Hills' strong financial position, high credit ratings, and ongoing equity issuance program provide flexibility to execute its strategic plans and continue its 50-year track record of dividend increases.
