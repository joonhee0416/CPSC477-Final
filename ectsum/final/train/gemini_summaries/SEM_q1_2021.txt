Select Medical's Q1 performance was strong, with overall net revenue increasing 9.3% to $1.55 billion. Occupancy rates rose 500 basis points in both critical illness recovery hospitals (75% occupancy) and inpatient rehabilitation hospitals (84% occupancy). Concentra's revenue increased 6.1% to $423 million. Notably, critical illness recovery hospital revenue grew 18.9% to $595 million, driven by higher acuity patients and increased volume. The company's adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 15.7% due to cost efficiencies and government support from the CARES Act and other COVID-related programs. Select Medical expects full-year 2021 revenue to be in the range of $5.7 billion to $5.9 billion, adjusted EBITDA between $870 million and $900 million, and earnings per common share between $2.41 and $2.58.
