Despite the ongoing challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company exhibited resilience and exceeded expectations in fiscal 2021. Net sales were $943 million, with impressive performance across most brands and market share gains. Adjusted earnings per share grew nearly 10% to $3.24, driven by lower operating costs and interest expenses. The company's diversified portfolio and e-commerce presence proved valuable, offsetting declines in pandemic-impacted categories like cough and cold. For fiscal 2022, the company projects revenue of $957-$962 million, with organic growth of 1.5-2% and earnings per share of $3.58 or more. Disciplined cost management and strong free cash flow are anticipated to drive double-digit earnings growth, while advertising and marketing expenses are expected to normalize. The company's stable financial profile and $225 million or more in forecasted free cash flow provide opportunities for continued investment in brands, debt reduction, and shareholder value.
