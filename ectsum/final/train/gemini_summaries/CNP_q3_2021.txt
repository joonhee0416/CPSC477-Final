CenterPoint Energy exceeded third-quarter expectations and raised its 2021 utility earnings per share guidance range to $1.26 - $1.28, representing a near 80% achievement of its annual goal. The company's growth strategy remains anchored by an $18 billion-plus, 5-year capital plan focused on enhancing safety, reliability, and clean energy investments. Despite slight weather-related delays, CenterPoint anticipates catching up with capital spending plans by early 2022. Additionally, the company reinforced its target of 8% annual utility earnings per share growth from 2022 to 2024, within the 6% to 8% range for the remaining years of its 10-year plan. CenterPoint is committed to becoming a pure-play regulated utility, emphasizing value optimization for stakeholders. The recent Arkansas and Oklahoma settlements, along with the anticipated Energy Transfer and Enable merger closure, support this transition.
