Extra Space Storage reported strong fundamentals in the first quarter of 2020, with same-store occupancy reaching all-time highs and sequential growth in January and February. The increased occupancy led to significant pricing power, with achieved rates exceeding 10% in March. Despite lower late fees, same-store revenue growth reached 4.6%, driven by higher occupancy and rates. The company's expense control efforts resulted in a 0.2% decrease in same-store expenses, contributing to same-store NOI growth of 6.5%. The strong performance in the first quarter and easier comps in the upcoming months have led to increased guidance, with annual core FFO expectations raised to $5.95-$6.10 per share. The company also highlighted continued external growth through acquisitions and third-party management, while exercising discipline in the acquisition market.
