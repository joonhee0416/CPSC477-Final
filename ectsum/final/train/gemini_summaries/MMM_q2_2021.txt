During Q2, 3M delivered strong performance across the board, with organic growth in all business groups and geographic areas. Strong execution resulted in increased earnings, expanded margins, and robust cash flow of $1.6 billion, representing a 103% conversion rate. Despite COVID-19 uncertainties, 3M raised its full-year organic growth guidance to 6-9% and earnings per share to $9.70-$10.10, citing ongoing market strength, home improvement growth, and healthcare demand.

The company also remains focused on investing in growth opportunities, productivity, and sustainability, while continuing its restructuring program. Overall, 3M expressed confidence in its ability to execute well amidst uncertainties and is well-positioned for continued growth and profitability.
