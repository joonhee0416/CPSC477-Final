Lamb Weston delivered solid sales volume in Q3 as restaurant traffic and demand gradually improved, with volume declines continuing to narrow as social restrictions eased. Notably, US restaurant traffic reached 85-90% of pre-pandemic levels, and global volume in other international markets also improved. Despite this progress, non-commercial demand from hospitality and healthcare sectors remained around 50% of pre-pandemic levels, and shipments in Europe softened due to reimposed restrictions. However, Lamb Weston anticipates a steady path towards demand recovery as governments continue to roll back restrictions, aided by increasing vaccinations. While the company's cost structure was impacted by pandemic-related disruptions in manufacturing, transportation, and warehousing, it expects this impact to be temporary and that its Win As One initiatives will optimize its long-term cost structure. The company remains optimistic that overall frozen potato demand will approach pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2021 and is investing strategically in a new facility in China and expansion of its Idaho operations.
