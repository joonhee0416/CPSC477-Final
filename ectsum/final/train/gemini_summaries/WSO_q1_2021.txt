Watsco reported record first-quarter results, driven by robust sales increases and enhanced operational efficiency. Earnings per share surged 93% to $1.39, hitting record highs in sales, gross profits, and net income. Double-digit growth was achieved in equipment, non-equipment, and commercial refrigeration product categories. Notably, residential HVAC equipment sales grew 18% over both the quarter and the past year. This performance is projected to continue with the company expecting a solid year, anticipating 2021 as another record-breaking year. Watsco's technology initiatives continue to drive growth, leading to new customer acquisition and increased market share. Moreover, the company's balance sheet remains robust, and it recently closed the acquisition of Temperature Equipment Corporation (TEC), marking its debut in the Midwest. With dividend payments having been increased by 10% in April 2021, Watsco's commitment to shareholders continues, and the company seeks further growth and acquisition opportunities in the industry.
