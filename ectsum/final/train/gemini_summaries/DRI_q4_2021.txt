Darden Restaurants reported strong Q4 results, driven by increased consumer demand and strategic investments in food quality, team members, and technology. Same-restaurant sales exceeded pre-COVID levels, particularly at Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse, while off-premise sales remained robust. The company achieved record restaurant-level EBITDA margins and quarterly EBITDA, propelled by higher food costs and lower restaurant labor expenses due to operational simplifications. Darden's total sales are projected to grow 5-8% in fiscal 2022, exceeding pre-COVID levels, with a same-restaurant sales increase of 25-29%. The company expects $1.5-1.59 billion in EBITDA and $7.00-7.50 in diluted net earnings per share, reflecting the continued transformation of its business model and focus on profitable sales growth.
