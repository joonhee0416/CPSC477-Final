LP's Q4 results exceeded expectations, with SmartSide sales surging by 30% and OSB prices remaining exceptionally high, driving EBITDA to $781 million. The company announced a two-phase SmartSide capacity expansion strategy, converting mills in Maine and Michigan to increase capacity by 520 million square feet while reducing OSB capacity by 670 million feet. LP reported a 30% revenue increase for SmartSide, with a high incremental margin of $0.51 per dollar, resulting in $30 million of additional EBITDA. Despite supply chain disruptions impacting MDI availability, the company prioritized SmartSide production and raised its long-term EBITDA margin target to 25%. Planned investments of $220-$230 million for 2021 include the Houlton conversion, growth projects, and base maintenance. LP's strong performance and healthy cash flow position will allow it to continue share buybacks, following its strategy of returning 50% of excess cash to shareholders. The company expects Q1 2021 EBITDA to exceed $380 million, driven by accelerating SmartSide growth and rebounding OSB prices.
