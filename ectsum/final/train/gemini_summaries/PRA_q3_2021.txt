Despite the ongoing challenges of the pandemic, the company reported a strong third quarter with a solid net income of $12.2 million ($0.23 per share) and operating income of $13.8 million ($0.25 per share). Notably, the Specialty P&C segment saw continued growth driven by rate gains, retention, and NORCAL premium integration, resulting in expense ratio reductions. The Workers' Compensation segment remains profitable, with a current accident year loss ratio of 77.8% and a combined ratio of 109.3%, despite facing a challenging loss environment. The Lloyd's Syndicate segment experienced higher claim activity, particularly in natural catastrophes. However, the Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment maintained a combined ratio of 87.7%, driven by favorable loss reserve development and premium growth. The company remains optimistic about its ability to navigate economic cycles and uncertainty.
