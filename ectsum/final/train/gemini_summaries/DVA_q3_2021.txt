They achieved a significant milestone by increasing their home dialysis patients to over 15%, providing access to more convenient and efficient care. DaVita continues to innovate their platform, offering enhanced education programs, a patient portal, and a team of expert home physicians. While the COVID-19 pandemic remains a concern, DaVita has seen a decline in new cases and mortality rates among its patients due to vaccinations. The company revised its adjusted OI guidance due to COVID impact and expects operating income to decrease in Q4. Despite these headwinds, DaVita anticipates a strong 2023 with a reversal of 2022 headwinds and incremental operating income growth.
