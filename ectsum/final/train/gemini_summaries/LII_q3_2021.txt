In the third quarter, Lennox International experienced supply chain disruptions and COVID-19 labor challenges, which negatively impacted revenue and operating profit by approximately $75 million each. Despite these headwinds, revenue slightly increased to a record $1.06 billion due to strong pricing in the shipment-constrained environment. However, total segment profit and margin declined. The residential segment saw a drop in replacement business and a strong increase in new construction. The company remains optimistic about the residential market due to factors such as more people working from home, rising temperatures, and the ban on R22 refrigerant systems. In contrast, the commercial segment faced challenges, with a significant decline in profit and margin due to supply chain shortages and COVID-19 impacts. Lennox International revised its guidance for 2021 revenue growth to 13%-15% and narrowed its earnings per share (adjusted and GAAP) guidance ranges. The company expects continued industry growth in 2022 and plans to open a third plant in Mexico for increased productivity and cost savings.
