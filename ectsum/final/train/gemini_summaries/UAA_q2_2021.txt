Under Armour's Q2 2021 financial performance exceeded expectations, with a 91% revenue increase to $1.4 billion. Despite the ongoing challenges posed by COVID-19, the company's sharpened focus on brand strength, operating model improvement, DTC expansion, and profitability is paying off. Notably, diluted earnings per share through the first six months of 2021 have surpassed full-year 2019 results. The company is implementing cost-saving measures to achieve efficiency, including a reduction in restructuring charges and a shift to a distributor model in certain Latin American countries. Under Armour believes its investments in marketing and customer experience will set the stage for strong growth in 2022. However, the company acknowledges potential headwinds such as supply chain disruptions and the absence of MyFitnessPal's revenue. Despite these challenges, Under Armour remains optimistic about its ability to drive profitability and deliver on its next chapter of growth.
