Camden continues to witness significant improvement in its multifamily business, surpassing earlier estimates with accelerating occupancy and pricing power. Across all markets, same-property revenue growth reached 4.1%, driven by remarkable performance in Phoenix, Tampa, Southeast Florida, Atlanta, and Raleigh. Pricing power remains strong, with new lease and renewal rates reaching 9.3% and 6.7%, respectively, in Q2 and trending even higher in July at 18.7% and 10.5%. This has led to a revised 2021 full-year guidance, with a 350 basis point increase in same-store NOI guidance to 3.75% and a $0.18 increase in FFO guidance to $5.27 per share. The outlook for the apartment business remains positive, with strong demand exceeding anticipated supply, and Camden's acquisition and development teams actively pursuing opportunities in a competitive environment.
