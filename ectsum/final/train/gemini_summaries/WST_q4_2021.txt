West Pharmaceutical Services had a remarkable 2021 with 28% organic sales growth in Q4, driven by high demand for COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics and impressive performance in the proprietary products segment. The company's committed order book is at an all-time high, and they continue to invest in capacity expansion. In terms of guidance, full-year 2022 sales are projected to range from $3.05 billion to $3.075 billion, with an estimated $70 million headwind from foreign exchange rates. Organic sales growth is expected to be approximately 10%, driven by mid-teens growth in the proprietary business. Reported diluted earnings per share guidance is forecasted to be in the range of $9.20 to $9.35, excluding future tax benefits from stock-based compensation. The strong financial performance reflects the success of West's market-led strategy and its commitment to delivering value to stakeholders and supporting patient health.
