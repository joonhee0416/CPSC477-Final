In 2020, Lilly Pulitzer faced challenges but remained resilient. E-commerce growth surged to 43% of total sales, a significant increase from 23% in 2019. Physical stores faced closures but are seeing gradual recovery. In fiscal 2020, adjusted gross margin decreased to 55.1% due to discounts and inventory markdowns, partially offset by higher IMUs and a shift in product design. Adjusted SG&A expenses were reduced by $93 million, including employment and occupancy cost reductions. Looking ahead to 2021, the company anticipates solid top and bottom line growth. Sales are projected between $220-$240 million in the first quarter and $940-$980 million for the full year. Adjusted earnings per share estimates range from $0.95 to $1.15 in the first quarter and $2.80 to $3.20 for the full fiscal year. The company's strong balance sheet with no debt and ample cash provides a solid foundation for future growth.
