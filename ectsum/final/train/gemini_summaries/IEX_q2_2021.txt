IDEX Corporation delivered strong financial results in Q2, driven by record orders and a robust backlog, despite ongoing supply chain disruptions and inflation. All three segments experienced double-digit organic order growth, with Fluid and Metering Technologies and Fire and Safety Diversified Products seeing particularly strong increases. The Health and Science Technologies segment also saw significant growth in semiconductor, food, and pharma markets.

IDEX's organic sales grew 17% year-over-year, with an 11% impact from the FMD acquisition. The company's gross margin expanded to 44.6%, driven by increased volume and price capture. Adjusted operating margin also saw a significant increase to 24.4%, fueled by gross margin expansion and fixed cost leverage.

IDEX raised its full-year earnings per share guidance from $6.05-$6.20 to $6.26-$6.36. Organic revenue growth for the year is now projected to be 11-12%, up from 9-10%. The company is also investing heavily in growth opportunities, with capital expenditures expected to increase by $10 million.

Despite supply chain headwinds and cost pressures, IDEX remains confident in its ability to execute on its growth strategy. The company is actively pursuing acquisitions and organic investment to drive long-term value creation. IDEX's commitment to operational productivity and margin improvement is also expected to mitigate the impact of rising costs.
