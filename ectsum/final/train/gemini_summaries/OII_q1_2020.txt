Despite a $368 million net loss in Q1 2020, Oceaneering International exceeded expectations with an adjusted net income of $3.5 million ($0.04 per share) due to reduced costs and strong performance in energy-focused businesses. The company adjusted its financial performance to account for pre-tax adjustments of $393 million, including $303 million in goodwill impairments, asset write-offs, and restructuring costs. To mitigate the impact of the pandemic, Oceaneering initiated cost reduction measures targeting $125-$160 million in annualized expenses by year-end, including $70 million in already implemented initiatives. Management compensation and 401(k) matching contributions have been reduced, and the company is streamlining operations by consolidating facilities and eliminating non-value-added expenses. With a strong balance sheet, Oceaneering remains optimistic about its ability to adapt to market changes and succeed in the evolving environment.
