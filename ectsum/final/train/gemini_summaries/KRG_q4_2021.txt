Kite Realty Group's earnings surged in Q4 following its merger with RPAI, resulting in an immediate earnings accretion and exceeding expectations. Despite only having two months of contribution from RPAI assets, KRG generated $0.43 FFO per share, attributing primarily to operational efficiency improvements and strong demand for open-air retail space. Leasing momentum remains robust, with KRG achieving a 12.9% blended cash spread on comparable new and renewal leases. The company boasts a high occupancy rate of 93.4% and has a significant $33 million in signed but not-open NOI, which is expected to come online in 2022 and 2023, further solidifying its growth trajectory. KRG's improved scale and balance sheet provide opportunities for lower debt costs, increased liquidity, and enhanced tenant relationships. The integration process is also progressing smoothly, enabling the combined organization to operate effectively. Notably, KRG's FFO guidance for 2022 ranges from $1.69 to $1.75 per share, which represents a 15% increase over its original 2020 per-share guidance and demonstrates the strong contribution of the merger.
