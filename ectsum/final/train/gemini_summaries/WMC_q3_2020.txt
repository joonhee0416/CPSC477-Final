During the third quarter, Valuant Mortgage Credit's GAAP book value increased to $4.07 per share, driven by improvements in asset valuations. The company reported GAAP net income of $59.8 million ($0.98 per share) and core earnings of $6.4 million ($0.10 per share). The net interest margin improved to 2.27%, contributing to solid core earnings despite reduced recourse leverage. In response to these positive results, the company reinstated its dividend at $0.05 per share. Core earnings surpassed expectations, supported by a higher net interest margin and lower financing costs from the Arroyo securitization. The non-QM residential loan portfolio performed well, with a decline in forbearance rates to 10%. The commercial loan and non-agency CMBS portfolios also met expectations, showing resilience during the pandemic. The company's focus on high-quality borrowers is seen as a strength in the uncertain environment. While the economic recovery remains dependent on the pandemic's trajectory, Valuant Mortgage Credit remains optimistic about its future performance.
