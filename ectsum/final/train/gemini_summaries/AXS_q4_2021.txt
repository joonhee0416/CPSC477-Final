AXIS delivered a strong quarter and year, evidencing progress in its multi-year transformation. The company has reduced its attritional ratio by 9 points and current year ex-cat combined ratio by 10 points since 2017, while reducing PML by over 50%. Despite a tough cat year, the cat loss ratio remained steady at 9.5%. AXIS's specialty insurance franchise continues to thrive, producing $4.9 billion in gross premium in 2021 and is expected to approach 70% this year. The insurance segment achieved a combined ratio of 91.6, the best since 2010, and a parent year ex-cat combined ratio of 85.9, the lowest since 2006. The reinsurance business also showed improvement, with a combined ratio below 100 and a current year ex-cat combined ratio of 86.3, the best since 2012. During the January 1 renewals, AXIS reduced its reinsurance property and property cat premiums by 45% to reduce volatility and optimize its portfolio. Despite the portfolio shift, AXIS expects an improvement in overall technical ratios with lower volatility. The company remains focused on growth, capital allocation, and delivering value to stakeholders.
