Quanex Building Products reported a 10.5% decline in Q3 revenue to $212.1 million, primarily due to COVID-19 disruptions, with a decrease in all segments except European fenestration. Despite the revenue decline, the company saw an increase in adjusted earnings per share to $0.34. Driven by cost optimization and margin improvement, European fenestration saw revenue edging down 12.9%, while North American cabinet components revenue fell 11.5% due to supply chain disruptions but would have declined only 7.5% excluding one customer's exit. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $27.7 million, down from $32.8 million last year. Cash provided by operating activities increased significantly by 50.8% to $45.1 million, resulting in a strong 57.1% increase in free cash flow to $40.7 million. The company's focus on working capital management contributed to these cash flow improvements. Quanex withdrew its previous full-year guidance due to the pandemic's uncertainty but now provides revised guidance, estimating net sales of $832 million to $837 million and adjusted EBITDA of $97 million to $102 million, with an expected leverage ratio of net debt to last 12 months adjusted EBITDA at or below one time by the end of fiscal 2020.
