ResMed's second quarter results continue to showcase strong performance in its Sleep and Respiratory Care business, benefiting from high demand for its devices due to post-COVID recovery, competitor recall, and ongoing demand associated with respiratory conditions. Despite supply chain challenges affecting electronic components and freight, ResMed has implemented allocation processes to prioritize production and delivery of devices to meet the needs of high-acuity patients. The company has also been reengineering designs and accelerating new product development to catch up with demand. While overall demand remains high, supply constraints are expected to limit incremental revenue from the competitor recall to $300-350 million for the full year. ResMed continues to invest in R&D, with a focus on innovative solutions and digital health technologies that enhance patient outcomes and efficiency for healthcare providers. The company's SaaS business experienced sequential growth, driven by increased demand for home-based care, and is expected to accelerate growth as COVID-related headwinds subside. ResMed remains optimistic about its long-term strategy, pipeline of solutions, and ability to transform out-of-hospital healthcare at scale.
