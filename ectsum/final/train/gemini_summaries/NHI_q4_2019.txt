NHI announced $329 million in acquisitions in 2019 and has already announced $150 million in 2020, including the Class A Timber Ridge CCRC in Seattle, marking a return to RIDEA investments with an embedded triple net lease. NHI increased its dividend by 5% for the 11th consecutive year. While industry challenges persist, NHI remains committed to strategic asset management and is actively seeking opportunities to improve portfolio performance through partnerships with premier operators.
