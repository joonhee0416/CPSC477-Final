Teledyne delivered impressive financial results in Q3, achieving record revenue, driven by organic growth and the acquisition of FLIR. Organic growth across all major business groups was particularly strong in digital imaging and test equipment, exceeding 20% each. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $4.34, a significant 61.9% increase year-over-year. Teledyne has successfully integrated FLIR, accelerating cost synergies and expects to reach its annualized $80 million savings target ahead of schedule. Despite supply chain challenges, the company remains optimistic, raising its full-year guidance to $4.59 billion in sales and 21% adjusted operating margin. Digital Imaging's strong performance was supported by organic growth and the addition of FLIR, while Instrumentation saw exceptional growth in test and measurement systems. Aerospace and Defense Electronics recorded revenue increases in both defense and commercial aerospace. Overall, Teledyne's financial position is strong, with cash flow allowing for debt reduction and a declining leverage ratio. The company reaffirmed its commitment to margin improvement, which has been a key focus for the past several years.
