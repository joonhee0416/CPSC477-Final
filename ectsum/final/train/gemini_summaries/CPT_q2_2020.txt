Camden's business has performed better than expected during the pandemic, with stronger-than-anticipated apartment demand even amid high unemployment. Geographic diversification, including more Sunbelt markets with fewer job losses, and a product mix offering various price points have supported this performance. The company's investments in technology, including cloud-based operating systems and the Chirp access system, have allowed for seamless leasing operations. Camden's strong balance sheet and liquidity of $1.4 billion provides financial stability. For the third quarter, same-store revenue is projected to decline by 1.6%, driven by lower occupancy, higher bad debt, and lower miscellaneous income. However, FFO per share is expected to improve to within a range of $1.14 to $1.20, with a midpoint of $1.17. While the company has issued guidance for the third quarter, a full-year outlook remains uncertain due to ongoing COVID-19 impacts.
