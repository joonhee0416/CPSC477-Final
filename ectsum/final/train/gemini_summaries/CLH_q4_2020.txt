In 2020, Clean Harbors' financial performance exceeded expectations, with adjusted EBITDA growing 3% to $555.3 million and record adjusted free cash flow of $265 million. Despite ongoing pandemic challenges, Environmental Services outperformed, driven by high-value waste, COVID-19 decontamination work, and cost controls, recording an impressive 13% increase in adjusted EBITDA with margins up nearly 400 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2021 is in the range of $545 million to $585 million, with Environmental Services experiencing a mid-single-digit decline on a percentage basis due to the reduction in high-margin decontamination work and government assistance but expecting growth in incineration, service businesses, and cost measures. Safety-Kleen is projected to see a mid- to high-single-digit percentage increase in adjusted EBITDA, benefiting from a rebound in the branch business and improved performance in SK Oil. The company is optimistic about 2021, citing rising industrial production, a strong sales pipeline, and opportunities for decontamination work and disposal of vaccination waste volumes.
