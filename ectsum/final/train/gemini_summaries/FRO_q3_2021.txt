In Q3 2021, Frontline faced market challenges but outperformed peers with revenues of $10,500 per VLCC day, $7,900 per Suezmax day, and $10,700 per LR2/Aframax day. In Q4, these rates have significantly increased to $21,600, $17,900, and $16,000 respectively, indicating market recovery. Frontline has secured financing of up to $507 million for new vessel acquisitions, reducing borrowing costs and cash breakeven. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the Omicron variant and oil supply disruptions, Frontline's financial commitments are fully funded. Notably, tanker recycling has increased to close to 2% of the fleet, potentially accelerating the fleet's reduction. Demand and supply of oil continue to rise, while the SPR release and OPEC's actions remain uncertain. Nonetheless, Frontline is well-positioned to navigate the market outlook.
