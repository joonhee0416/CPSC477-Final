In Q1 2021, Fresh Del Monte Produce reported strong profits across segments despite a 3% decline in net sales to $1.88 billion. Gross profit surged 53%, and net income increased 228% to $43 million, driven by increased profitability in the fresh and value-added business segment. The company faced inflationary pressures and reduced sales volume in melons and food service distribution channels. However, it implemented cost-saving initiatives and benefited from increased volume in pineapple and avocado. Fresh-cut fruit margins recovered, and avocado and prepared food product margins achieved double digits. Banana segment pricing increased 7%, offsetting hurricane-related production costs. Adjusted EBITDA increased 61%, and earnings per share rose to $0.90. The company remains agile and intends to counter market challenges proactively. It has generated cash flow from operating activities of $47 million and is on track to achieve its $100 million asset optimization program by Q1 2022.
