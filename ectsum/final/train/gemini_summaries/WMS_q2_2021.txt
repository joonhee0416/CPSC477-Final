In Q2 2021, the company achieved a strong 10% growth in net sales, driven by a 63% surge in Infiltrator revenues and a 15% increase in legacy ADS' residential sales. The residential market continues to thrive, contributing 38% of domestic sales, up from 28% last year, while the nonresidential market remains stable, with pockets of growth in horizontal construction, data centers, and warehouses. Infiltrator continues to exceed expectations, with double-digit growth in tanks and leach field products. The company's favorable market position and conversion strategy enable it to anticipate continued above-market growth. Adjusted EBITDA rose 47%, led by strong performance from Infiltrator and ADS' sales, operations, and distribution teams. Free cash flow increased significantly, driven by sales growth and working capital initiatives. The company expects fiscal 2021 net sales and adjusted EBITDA to grow by 7% to 10% and 37% to 42%, respectively.
