Prologis recently concluded a remarkable Q2 that exceeded expectations. Market conditions are favorable, with robust demand for space and the healthiest leasing activity in the company's history. E-commerce remains the leading customer segment, driving 30% of new lease signings. The shortage of supply, combined with high demand, has resulted in record rent growth of 4.1% in the U.S. and 10.3% globally. Prologis' financial performance was strong, with core FFO of $1.01 per share and cash same-store NOI growth of 5.8%. Strategic capital revenue is expected to reach $470 million due to increased property values and asset management fees. The company raised almost $600 million in the quarter and has land holdings that support $18 billion in future development. Prologis has increased its core FFO guidance to $4.04-$4.08 per share. Overall, the company is well-positioned for continued growth in the future.
