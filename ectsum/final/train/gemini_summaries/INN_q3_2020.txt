While the third quarter remained challenging for the hotel industry, Summit Hotel Properties saw sequential demand improvements, leading to better operating results compared to the second quarter. RevPAR improved each month, reaching $47 in the third quarter, an increase from $23 in the second quarter. The company continued to gain market share, with a 151% RevPAR index. October results showed further improvement, with an expected RevPAR of $50, reflecting the highest ADR since the onset of the pandemic. Occupancy also remained strong at over 47% in October. The company's extended stay hotels performed particularly well, with occupancy exceeding 60% in each month of the third quarter. Summit Hotel Properties maintained lean staffing models throughout the pandemic and preserved liquidity by delaying nonessential capital expenditures and suspending dividend distributions, resulting in a cash burn rate of $4.5 million in September and a projected liquidity runway of nearly five years. Despite the uncertain near-term outlook, the company remains optimistic about the long-term prospects for travel demand and its well-positioned portfolio.
