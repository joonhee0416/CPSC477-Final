U.S. Bancorp reported earnings per share of $1.28 in Q2, exceeding expectations. The bank released $350 million in loan loss reserves due to an improved economic outlook and better-than-expected credit quality metrics. Net revenue totaled $5.8 billion, with growth in net interest income and fee businesses driven by improving consumer and business spending trends. Total payments revenue increased 39.5% year-over-year as all three payments businesses exceeded pre-pandemic sales volume levels. Credit quality remains strong, with net charge-off and non-performing asset ratios improving. The allowance for credit losses declined to 2.23% of loans as the bank remains confident in the economy. Given the favorable outlook, the company expects higher earnings in the second half of the year, supported by ongoing economic recovery, strong credit quality, and increased payments volume.
