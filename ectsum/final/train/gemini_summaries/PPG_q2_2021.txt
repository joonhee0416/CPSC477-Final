PPG reported record net sales of $4.4 billion in Q2, driven by improved performance across many businesses. Adjusted earnings per share reached $1.94, similar to pre-pandemic levels despite lower sales volume and significant raw material inflation. Supply disruptions severely impacted operations, leading to an estimated $200 million loss. However, the company remains confident that deferred sales will recover. Selling price increases are ongoing to offset inflation, which is expected to remain elevated in Q3. Acquisitions are projected to add $500 million in incremental sales in Q3, with meaningful synergies to follow. Despite inflationary challenges and pandemic impacts, PPG expects a low single-digit percentage increase in sales volume in Q3 and overall sales growth of over 20% compared to Q3 2020. Full-year adjusted earnings are forecasted to be $7.40 to $7.60, outpacing 2019 earnings despite sales volumes yet to recover fully. The Board has approved a 10% dividend increase, marking 50 consecutive years of annual dividend per share increases.
