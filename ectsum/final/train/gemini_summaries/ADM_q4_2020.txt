In the fourth quarter of 2020, ADM reported an adjusted segment operating profit of $1.15 billion, a 12% increase from Q4 2019. Despite lower than expected earnings per share compared to the same quarter last year due to the recognition of retroactive biodiesel tax credits, earnings excluding items grew by approximately 49%. For the full year, the company delivered record adjusted earnings per share of $3.59, with a trailing four-quarter adjusted ROIC of 7.7%. Ag Services and Oilseeds achieved outstanding results, with record global crush volumes and higher export demand from China. Additionally, the Carbohydrate Solutions team delivered significantly higher year-over-year results, driven by lower corn costs and increased demand for USP grade alcohol. The Nutrition team also showed growth, with a 24% increase in the quarter, driven by strong performances in human nutrition and specialty ingredients. Looking ahead to 2021, ADM expects strong execution, organic growth, and continued advancements in operational excellence initiatives to drive segment operating profit and another record year of earnings per share.
