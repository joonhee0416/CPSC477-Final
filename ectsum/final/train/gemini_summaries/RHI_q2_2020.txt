Robert Half's Q2 results reflect the impact of COVID-19, with companywide revenue declining 27% to $1.1 billion. Staffing revenues saw a particularly steep decline of 33%, resulting in a gross margin decrease of 260 basis points to 42.5%. However, Protiviti's strong performance has cushioned the blow, with revenue up 4% on an adjusted basis and operating margin at 10.6%. The firm has implemented cost-cutting measures, reducing expenses by 24%, and maintained operations remotely. Despite the downturn, there are signs of recovery, with staffing revenue growth in the last three weeks of June and into July. The company expects third-quarter revenue between $1.09 billion and $1.20 billion, with EPS estimated at $0.49 to $0.68. Looking ahead, Robert Half sees opportunities in remote work trends and the demand for skilled talent in a changing job market.
