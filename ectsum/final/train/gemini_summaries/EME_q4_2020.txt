In 2020, EMCOR delivered exceptional results, with an eighth consecutive year of record revenues, achieving $8.8 billion. The company also set records in adjusted earnings per diluted share, operating income, and operating income margin. They had record operating cash flow of $806 million, showcasing the company's financial strength and resilience. Their success was driven by diversity and demand for their services, with end markets proving resilient and providing opportunities for execution. Despite operating environment disruptions, revenue growth was powered by excellent execution in commercial sectors, particularly in data centers and telecommunications.

Looking ahead to 2021, EMCOR expects revenue to range from $9.2 billion to $9.4 billion, with earnings per diluted share between $6.20 and $6.70. This outlook is based on assumptions such as a modest nonresidential construction market decline but continued execution in resilient market sectors like data centers, logistics, water and wastewater, healthcare, and energy retrofits. Additionally, the company anticipates growing demand for indoor air quality and efficiency projects.

EMCOR's guidance also considers the impact of the recent Texas power outages, which affected their operations and customer sites. However, the company anticipates resuming operations and completing planned maintenance and repairs, potentially extending planned first quarter work into the second quarter.

Overall, EMCOR remains optimistic about its prospects, citing a strong leadership team, skilled employees, and a commitment to safety and productivity. The company will continue to allocate capital in a balanced manner, investing in organic growth, acquisitions, share repurchases, and dividends.
