FIS reported its strongest-ever quarter with revenue of $3.5 billion, driven by 17% year-over-year growth and strong cross-selling. The company's revenue synergy target was raised to $700 million for 2021, and it expects 7% to 9% revenue growth through 2024. Recent wins include Walmart implementing FIS's Premium Payback program, American Express cross-selling an additional functionality module for Modern Banking Platform, and Fifth Third Bank expanding its relationship with FIS in its journey to modernize its technical infrastructure. FIS continues to invest in new solutions, with revenue from these offerings growing from less than 1% of total revenue in 2019 to over 4% in 2021. The company's strong financial performance is reflected in its high adjusted EBITDA margins, with an anticipated expansion of 50 basis points sequentially in Q3. During the quarter, FIS repurchased 2.7 million shares and generated over $1 billion in free cash flow, the highest in its history.
