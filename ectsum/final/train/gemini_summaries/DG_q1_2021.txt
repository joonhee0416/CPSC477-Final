Comparable store sales declined by 4.6% but increased by a robust 17.1% on a two-year stack basis. The company increased its market share in highly consumable product sales, and its retention rate of new customers remained encouraging. Merchandise inventories increased by 24.2% to $5.1 billion at the end of Q1, driven by strategic inventory purchases to support sales momentum.
