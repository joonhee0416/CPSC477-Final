Sherwin-Williams' Q3 sales rose 11% to over $5.2 billion, marking a fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, despite supply chain challenges and labor shortages. The Plumbing segment saw a 15% increase in sales, driven by strong growth in faucets, showers, and spas. However, the Decorative Architectural segment experienced a 4% sales growth compared to a 19% comp in Q3 2020, due to moderating DIY paint demand. Despite this, DIY paint sales were still 20% higher than in Q3 2019, indicating a reengaged homeowner and strong home improvement fundamentals. The operating margin was 17.5% due to planned increases in SG&A expenses. The company experienced low double-digit inflation in Q3 and expects mid-teens inflation in Q4, but expects to achieve price-cost neutrality by year-end through pricing actions. Despite these challenges, Sherwin-Williams remains optimistic about continued growth and margin expansion in 2022.
