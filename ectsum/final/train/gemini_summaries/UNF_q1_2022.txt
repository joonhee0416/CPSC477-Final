UniFirst's Q1 performance exhibited overall growth, with an 8.8% increase in consolidated revenues to $486.2 million. Notably, new account sales and customer retention improved, despite inflationary pressures impacting costs. Adjusted operating margin was impacted by investments in strategic initiatives, excluding which the margin was 9.9%. The core laundry operations contributed the majority of revenues, with 9.1% growth primarily due to customer reopenings, strong sales, and cost adjustments. The specialty garments segment also saw growth, with increased cleanroom and European nuclear operations, while the first aid segment expanded its van business. Despite challenges in the operating environment, UniFirst remains confident in executing through obstacles, expecting full-year revenues between $1.94 billion and $1.955 billion. Adjusted diluted earnings per share are projected within the range of $7.00 to $7.30, reflecting the exclusion of $38 million in costs related to key strategic initiatives.
