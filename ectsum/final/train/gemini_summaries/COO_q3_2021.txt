CooperVision and CooperSurgical reported exceptional third-quarter results, driving record revenue and earnings. CooperVision's growth was fueled by its daily silicone hydrogel portfolio and MyDay and clariti lenses, which performed strongly.

CooperSurgical's PARAGARD benefited from a price increase, which will positively impact long-term revenue. The company's gross margin expanded to 68.3%, while operating expenses increased to 28% due to continued investment in high-growth areas. Free cash flow remained strong at $180 million, and the adjusted leverage ratio improved to 1.5 times. Overall, the company remains confident in its ability to deliver strong performance moving forward.
