Raymond James Financial reported strong Q3 results with record quarterly net revenues of $2.47 billion, a 35% annual increase. Asset management fees surged 8% sequentially, driven by growth in fee-based assets. Investment banking revenues hit $276 million, a 99% year-over-year jump, fueled by record M&A activity. However, brokerage revenues fell 7% from the previous quarter due to lower trading volumes. Client interest program deposits at the broker dealer reached $8.6 billion, providing potential for future earnings. Net interest income from third-party banks declined slightly to $183 million, reflecting the low-interest-rate environment. Expenses were well-managed, with the compensation ratio decreasing to 67.2%. The firm repurchased 375,000 shares for $48 million and maintains a strong capital position. Credit quality remains healthy at Raymond James Bank, with non-performing assets at a low 12 basis points. The firm is optimistic about Q4, citing strong pipelines in financial advisor recruiting and investment banking, and anticipates growth across core businesses, continued technology investments, and strategic M&A. The recent announcement of an acquisition offer for Charles Stanley Group is aligned with these initiatives.
