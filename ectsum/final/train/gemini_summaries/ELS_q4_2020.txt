Despite a challenging year, the company experienced strong core operations and FFO growth, including a 10% increase in normalized FFO per share in the quarter. The demand for manufactured housing (MH) properties remained resilient throughout 2020, with a 4.6% increase in rent revenue and a 293-site occupancy increase. Similarly, the RV business demonstrated strength, with a 15% growth in core transient revenue. The Thousand Trails membership portfolio also performed well, with a 4% increase in dues revenue and a 15% increase in upgrade sales. The company is optimistic about 2021, despite continued challenges, and has issued guidance of $2.31 at the midpoint, indicating a 6.4% growth in normalized FFO per share. The guidance is supported by increased demand for MH communities, with a 30% increase in new home sales year-over-year and anticipated 4.2% rate growth in MH revenue. However, the first quarter is expected to be impacted by COVID-related travel issues, with a projected revenue decline of almost $10 million due to reduced Canadian traffic. Reservations for seasonal stays in the 2021-'22 winter season remain strong, providing an optimistic outlook for the future.
