The company had a successful quarter, leading to increased 2021 operating FFO guidance of $0.90 to $0.94 per share, driven by factors such as bad debt reversals and lease termination fees. Acquisitions totaled $500 million in 2021, with ongoing efforts to reshape the portfolio by focusing on higher-growth markets like Boston, Atlanta, and Tampa. The company raised or received commitments for $670 million in capital from various sources, strengthening its liquidity and balance sheet. Despite the competitive acquisition landscape, the company's three investment platforms provide a competitive advantage for acquiring at higher returns. The balance sheet remains strong, with refinancing plans to reduce debt maturities through 2024 to just 16% of the debt stack. Key factors that will drive results within the guidance range include the timing of net lease parcel sales and bad debt reserves, as well as incentive compensation and increased G&A expenses related to travel and talent investments.
