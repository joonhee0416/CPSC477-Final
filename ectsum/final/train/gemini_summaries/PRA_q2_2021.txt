ProAssurance reported a solid Q2 with net income of $92.1 million, driven by a gain on NORCAL acquisition and strong investment returns. Excluding one-time transaction costs, non-GAAP operating income was $26.6 million ($0.49 per share). All segments contributed to profitability, with Specialty P&C showing strong rate gains, solid retention, and top-line growth. The Workers' Compensation Insurance and Segregated Portfolio Sale Reinsurance businesses both produced underwriting income despite a challenging marketplace. Gross premiums written increased 13% year-over-year, primarily due to NORCAL's addition. The company observed higher claims activity in its small business unit as pandemic restrictions eased, leading to an increase in the accident year loss ratio to 72%. Despite this, frequency remains below pre-pandemic levels. The Lloyd's business also delivered improved results, with a significant underwriting gain of $4.3 million despite reduced participation. The company remains confident in its team and strategies, and looks forward to further progress in the second half of the year.
