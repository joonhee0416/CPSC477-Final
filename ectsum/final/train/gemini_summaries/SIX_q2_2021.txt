Six Flags reported encouraging results for the second quarter, with strong demand and revenue growth driven by record guest spending per capita. Through July 25, attendance reached 82% of 2019 levels, with year-to-date attendance at open parks surpassing 89% of 2019 numbers. Despite labor challenges, the company's revenue management strategies and transformation initiatives led to a 23% increase in guest spending per capita. Adjusted EBITDA declined slightly, but the company projects a $530-$560 million baseline once attendance returns to 2019 levels, with mid- to high-single digit annual growth thereafter. Six Flags is prioritizing investments in park infrastructure, technology, and strategic acquisitions, with a focus on improving guest experiences and operational efficiency. The company's Active Pass Base remains strong, and its transformation initiatives are yielding positive results, positioning Six Flags for continued growth in the second half of 2021 and beyond.
