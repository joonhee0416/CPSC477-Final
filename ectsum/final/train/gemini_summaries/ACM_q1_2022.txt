AECOM experienced a strong start to the fiscal year, exceeding expectations on all key financial metrics. Despite a 1% revenue decline to $3.3 billion, AECOM delivered positive organic NSR growth, a record first-quarter margin, and double-digit adjusted EBITDA and earnings per share growth. The company's margin was 13.7%, with the adjusted operating margin increasing by 60 basis points. AECOM's wins totaled $3.6 billion, with a 1.4 book-to-burn ratio in the Americas design business and a 1.2 ratio globally. The pipeline has never been stronger, with growth up by double digits despite strong wins this quarter. Key wins in construction management and a strong backlog in design continue to drive AECOM's success, with the backlog increasing by 5%. AECOM's adjusted EBITDA increased by 10%, and adjusted earnings per share increased by 44%. The company's financial performance has been driven by increased demand for advisory and program management services, as well as strong operational performance. To foster a culture of winning, AECOM is investing in program management and advisory capabilities, digital AECOM, and team building to capitalize on the growing market. This has resulted in a high win rate, leading to eight out of ten strategic pursuits being won. The company's commitment to employee engagement and a great workplace culture has been reflected in an increase in the percentage of employees recommending AECOM as a great place to work. AECOM remains optimistic about the future, aiming to fully capitalize on opportunities with strong client demand and a solid foundation for success.
