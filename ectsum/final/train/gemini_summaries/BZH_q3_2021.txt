Despite economic uncertainties, the company reported a successful third quarter with strong financial results. Sales pace was high, but deliberately slowed to manage production capacity and inflation. Operating margin, EBITDA, and net income increased due to pricing and overhead leverage. The company increased its lot position and share of lots controlled by option while reducing debt, demonstrating its balanced growth strategy. Full-year earnings per share guidance is raised to at least $3.25, driven by a strong backlog, overhead cost management, and interest expense reductions. The company sees continued demand for new homes but expects home price appreciation to moderate due to disciplined mortgage underwriting. Its market positioning, with a focus on affordability and customer-facing differentiators, will be advantageous. Land spending increased, with most deals secured under contract at favorable prices. The company remains focused on minimizing risk through strict underwriting and option lot control. Liquidity remains strong, and debt reduction efforts are on track. The company is confident in its balanced growth strategy and is excited about future growth prospects.
