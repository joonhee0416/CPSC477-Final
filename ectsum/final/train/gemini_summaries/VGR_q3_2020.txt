Vector Group reported a stable revenue of $1.45 billion for the first nine months of 2020. Despite the pandemic's significant impact on Douglas Elliman's Q2 performance, the real estate segment saw revenue increases in Q1 and Q3. Liggett Vector Brands experienced growth in net pricing and a decrease in MSA expenses, resulting in higher gross profit margins and increased earnings. The company expanded the distribution of its Montego brand into 10 additional states, recognizing its potential for volume growth in the growing deep discount segment. With strong cash reserves, Vector Group is well-positioned to navigate market challenges, maintain market share, and pursue profit growth. The company has a strong commitment to paying quarterly cash dividends, which is expected to continue indefinitely.
