Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, the company delivered solid performance in Q1 with an operating margin of 15.7%. Treatment volumes declined in Q1, but have since improved, leading the company to believe that patient census growth could return to pre-COVID levels by year-end. COVID cases and mortality rates have declined significantly among the company's dialysis population, resulting in a lower estimated net negative impact from COVID in 2021. The company expects to see an acceleration in net operating gain (NAG) in 2022 and 2023 due to potentially lower mortality rates. The company also expects to continue share repurchases and noted an increase in debt expense beginning next quarter due to a recent notes issuance. Despite temporary billing holds related to the winter storm and calcimimetics reimbursement changes, the company expects a positive impact on cash flow and DSOs over the next two quarters.
