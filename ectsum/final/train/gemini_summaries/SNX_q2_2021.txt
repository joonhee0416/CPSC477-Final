Synnex Corporation reported a strong Q2 with 31% revenue growth to $5.9 billion, exceeding expectations. Gross profit increased 20% despite a slight decline in gross margin due to product mix. Adjusted SG&A expenses declined, leading to a 67% improvement in non-GAAP operating margin to 2.9%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share grew by 68% to $2.09. The company reported improved cash flow, liquidity of $3.1 billion, and a 26-day cash conversion cycle. Looking ahead to Q3, revenue is projected to range from $4.95 billion to $5.45 billion, with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share expected to be between $1.90 and $2.10. The company notes strong demand across product categories, particularly in notebooks, Chromebooks, cloud, security, and services. The proposed merger with Tech Data is on track, with debt financing secured. The transaction is anticipated to close in the second half of 2021, and internal and external support for the merger remains positive. Despite supply chain challenges, Synnex is optimistic about the IT spending environment.
