Clean Harbors delivered exceptional Q3 results, with revenue up sequentially by $70 million despite a 13% year-over-year decline. Adjusted EBITDA grew 310 basis points to $161.2 million, supported by cost reduction efforts and government assistance, resulting in record margins and adjusted free cash flow of $123.5 million. Environmental Services revenue dipped but EBITDA increased due to cost reductions, higher margin work, and government programs. Safety-Kleen revenue also declined but recovered significantly in Q3, with EBITDA down primarily due to lower revenue. The company remains cautious about capital spending, focusing on high-return projects and preservation. Opportunities for acquisitions exist, and they anticipate being opportunistic in the future. Looking forward, they expect strong utilization in incineration and continued growth in Industrial and Tech Services. Field Services is expected to generate over $100 million in COVID-19 related revenue. Despite some project delays, they remain optimistic about the future, citing improving macroeconomic conditions and a position of strength as they close out 2020.
