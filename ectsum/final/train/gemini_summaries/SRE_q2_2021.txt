Sempra Energy reported solid financial results for Q2 2021, affirming their increased 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance and 2022 earnings per share guidance. Key developments include CPUC approval for SDG&E's wildfire mitigation plan, SoCalGas's advancement of renewable natural gas, and Oncor's increased projected capital plan to $14 billion for 2022-2026. Oncor's robust capital plan supports economic development, grid resiliency, and strong premise growth. The company's adjusted earnings per share were $1.63 in Q2 2021, up from $1.71 in Q2 2020. This increase was driven by higher equity earnings from Cameron LNG JV and lower losses at Parent and Other. Sempra Infrastructure also completed the exchange offer for IEnova's shares and plans to launch a cash tender offer for the remaining shares.
