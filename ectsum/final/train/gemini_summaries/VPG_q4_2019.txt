In Q4 2019, VPG's revenue was $69.1 million, exceeding expectations and representing a 2.6% increase from Q3 but a 10.2% decrease from the fourth quarter a year ago. Revenue slowed in the second half of the year due to a global economic slowdown. Despite market headwinds, VPG achieved an adjusted operating margin of 7.5%, driven by growth in all three segments. The company saw strong demand for precision resistors in semiconductor testing and solid orders in transportation and other markets. However, softness persisted in the oil and gas and industrial process sectors. VPG recorded acquisition-related charges and restructuring costs, impacting its profits in Q4. Adjusted net earnings per diluted share were $0.27, while the net leverage ratio stood at approximately one time. For Q1 2020, VPG projects net revenues between $63 million and $70 million, reflecting project-based business and lead time orders.
