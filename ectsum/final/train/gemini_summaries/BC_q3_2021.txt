Brunswick Corporation delivered an exceptional third quarter, setting new records for adjusted operating earnings and earnings per share despite ongoing supply chain challenges. Retail demand remains robust, with the company witnessing market share gains in its Mercury outboard engines and Freedom Boat Club continuing to expand its membership base. Despite elevated input costs, Brunswick has implemented price increases to offset inflation and anticipates further price adjustments in 2022. The company has raised its full-year guidance, projecting net sales of approximately $5.8 billion, adjusted operating margin growth of 150-180 basis points, and adjusted diluted earnings per share of around $8.15, a 61% increase over 2020. Brunswick remains focused on expanding its production capacity, integrating recent acquisitions, and investing in new product launches as it navigates supply chain headwinds and continues its strategic growth initiatives.
