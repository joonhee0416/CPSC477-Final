In Q1 2022, the company reported revenue growth of 16% to $267 million, driven by volume increases in the Fenestration segment and higher pricing due to inflationary pressures. Net income increased to $11.2 million from $7.9 million in Q1 2021, leading to an increase in earnings per share from $0.24 to $0.34. Adjusted earnings per share also rose by 25.9% to $0.34. Despite challenges such as supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, operational efficiency and increased pricing contributed to the growth. However, margin percentage decreased due to inflationary pressures and time lags in material index pricing mechanisms. For fiscal 2022, the company expects net sales of $1.13 billion to $1.15 billion, with margin expansion expected to be second-half weighted due to easier comparisons and the benefits of pricing strategy.
