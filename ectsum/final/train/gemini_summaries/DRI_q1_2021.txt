During the first quarter, Darden Restaurants experienced a 28% decline in sales compared to last year's same period. Despite this decline, Olive Garden increased its segment profit margin by 110 basis points, driven by simplified operations. LongHorn Steakhouse, Fine Dining, and the other business segment also reported positive segment profit margins. Executives emphasized the company's continued focus on health and safety, streamlining menus and processes, and investing in technology to enhance the guest experience. Darden's first-quarter results exceeded expectations, leading to the reinstatement of a quarterly dividend and a strong liquidity position. For the second quarter, the company anticipates EBITDA between $200 million and $215 million and diluted net earnings per share between $0.65 and $0.75. Management highlighted the variability in sales comparisons due to capacity constraints but expressed confidence in achieving pre-COVID EBITDA levels at approximately 90% of pre-COVID sales.
