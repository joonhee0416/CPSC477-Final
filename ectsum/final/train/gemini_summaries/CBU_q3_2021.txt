Earnings for the third quarter met expectations, with solid loan growth in all portfolios except PPP. Strong performances in financial services businesses, such as wealth and insurance, contributed to a 22% increase in pre-tax earnings. The company increased its securities book and closed on the acquisition of Fringe Benefits Design of Minnesota, which is expected to drive future earnings. Despite headwinds from margin, earnings per share were $0.83, marking an increase in GAAP earnings per share from Q3 2020 but a slight decrease on an operating basis. The company remains focused on loan generation, with robust pipelines and strong asset quality. Additionally, the announcement of the pending acquisition of Elmira Savings Bank is expected to be accretive to earnings. The company's strong cash position provides liquidity and future earnings opportunities, while its non-banking businesses continue to support non-interest revenue diversification.
