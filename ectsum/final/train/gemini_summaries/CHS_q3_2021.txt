Earnings per share for the third quarter reached $0.15, the company's best performance since 2016, driven by robust comparable sales growth across all three brands. Chico's and White House Black Market have seen dramatic improvements with increased full-price sales and higher margins. Soma posted a 30% sales increase, indicating continued market share growth. Digital sales remain strong, with proprietary tools driving engagement and conversion rates. The company's financial position remains strong, with cash and marketable securities of $137.5 million. Cash flow generation allows for strategic investments, including continued store base right-sizing and lease renegotiations. Fourth-quarter sales are projected to reach $495-510 million, with gross margins and SG&A expenses in line with previous years. Earnings per share for the fourth quarter are expected to be between a break-even and $0.50, exceeding both 2020 and 2019 results. Overall, the company's turnaround strategy is accelerating, with all three brands driving growth and profitability, creating a sustainable foundation for future success.
