Spectrum Brands reported a solid third quarter, with organic net sales growth of 12% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 1.8%, driven by strength in all business units. The company reiterated its earnings framework for 2021, expecting mid-teens reported net sales and adjusted EBITDA growth. Despite inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions, Spectrum Brands maintained discipline and executed its winning playbook, investing in innovation, marketing, and advertising. Key drivers of growth included double-digit organic growth in Hardware & Home Improvement, strong demand for appliances and personal care products in Home & Personal Care, and continued momentum in Global Pet Care. Home & Garden faced challenges due to unfavorable weather, but the acquisition of Rejuvenate is expected to drive synergies. The company's Global Productivity Improvement Program continues to deliver cost savings, which are reinvested in growth initiatives. Headwinds from inflation and supply chain disruptions are expected to persist, but Spectrum Brands is taking mitigation actions to offset these impacts. The company remains optimistic about the future, with strong consumer demand, low interest rates, and a favorable housing market supporting its growth potential.
