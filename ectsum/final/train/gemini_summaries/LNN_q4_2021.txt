**Earnings Summary**

Despite facing margin headwinds, the company's total revenues surged 20% year-over-year to $153.6 million in the fourth quarter, driven by a 63% increase in irrigation segment revenues and a 30% rise in North American irrigation sales. Irrigation segment operating income increased 78%, with a margin of 8.4% due to higher unit sales and average selling prices offset by cost pressures. Infrastructure segment revenues declined 45% due to lower Road Zipper system sales. However, full-year revenues rose 20% to $567.6 million, with irrigation segment revenues increasing 35% and infrastructure segment revenues decreasing 23%. Net earnings saw a year-over-year decline in the fourth quarter, primarily due to an after-tax LIFO impact of $4.5 million, resulting in earnings per share of $0.53. For the full year, net earnings increased to $42.6 million, with earnings per share of $3.88. The company maintains a strong financial position with $196.7 million in total available liquidity and debt within financial covenant limits. Despite project delays anticipated in the beginning of fiscal 2022, the company remains optimistic about growth opportunities.
