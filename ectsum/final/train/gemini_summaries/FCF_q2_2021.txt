First Commonwealth reported a net income of $29.6 million, resulting in core earnings per share of $0.31. The company saw loan growth rebound, increasing to a 5.3% annualized rate excluding PPP loans. Lending growth was broad-based, with significant contributions across various lending segments. Noninterest income remained strong at $26.1 million, driven by growth in consumer and small business households, along with record high card-related interchange income and trust revenue. The bank maintained a solid asset quality, with nonperforming loans at 0.82% of total loans excluding PPP, and delinquency rates at an all-time low of 11 basis points. Despite a decline in net interest margin to 3.17%, the core NIM, which adjusts for PPP and cash effects, remained within guidance at 3.20%. The bank expects the NIM to improve due to strong loan growth and the reduction of excess cash. First Commonwealth also repurchased 72,724 shares in the second quarter and revised its noninterest expense guidance to $53 million to $54 million per quarter for the remainder of the year.
