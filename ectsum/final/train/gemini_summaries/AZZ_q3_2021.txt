AZZ Inc. reported Q3 consolidated sales of $227 million, slightly down from the prior year, but with sequential improvement in operating performance. Net income was $19.7 million, a 10% decrease year-over-year, resulting in earnings per share of $0.76 or $0.80 adjusted. The Metal Coatings segment performed well, generating higher operating income and margins. The Infrastructure Solutions segment saw sequential improvement but remained below prior year levels due to weak demand and lower international sales. The company has initiated a comprehensive strategic review of its Infrastructure Solutions businesses to maximize shareholder value. Despite the ongoing COVID-19 impact, AZZ repurchased over 652,000 shares in Q3, continuing its capital allocation strategy. The company is monitoring key indicators and remains committed to its growth strategy, targeting 21-23% operating margins in Metal Coatings and improving margins in Infrastructure Solutions while completing the strategic evaluation. M&A activity is anticipated, primarily in Metal Coatings, to support the company's growth plan.
