Brown & Brown's Q3 results showcase continued strong growth, driven by robust new business, retention, rate increases, and expansion of exposure units. The company achieved a 14.3% increase in total revenue and an impressive 280 basis point improvement in EBITDAC margin to 35.6%. Adjusted earnings per share grew to $0.58, excluding changes in estimated acquisition earn-out payables. Most lines saw consistent rate increases, with some exceptions such as workers' compensation rates decreasing 1% to 3% and commercial auto rates increasing 5% to 10%. The company remains focused on managing costs, resulting in increased income before income tax. Brown & Brown closed seven acquisitions during the quarter and expects the pipeline to remain full. The company anticipates continued business confidence and expansion, with premium increases moderating except for cyber, professional liability, excess, and automobile insurance.
