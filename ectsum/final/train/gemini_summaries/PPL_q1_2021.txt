Despite reporting a loss per share of $2.39 due to special items, the company's adjusted earnings from ongoing operations met expectations at $0.28 per share, matching last year's earnings. Improved margins, primarily driven by favorable weather conditions, contributed to this consistent performance. The company continues to operate well during the pandemic, with strong operational performance and the successful execution of strategic transactions virtually. The Kentucky rate case proceedings have resulted in settlement agreements that will provide recovery for retiring coal plants and the deployment of advanced metering infrastructure. Leadership changes have been made to prepare for long-term success, including the integration of Narragansett Electric into the company's regulated utilities. The Pennsylvania segment experienced flat results due to offsetting factors, while the Kentucky segment saw a $0.02 per share increase driven by higher sales volumes. Corporate and other results were slightly lower due to increased interest expense. Overall, the company remains committed to providing reliable energy services, closing strategic transactions, and repositioning itself for future growth.
