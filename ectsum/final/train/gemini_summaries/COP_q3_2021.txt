**Earnings Summary:**

ConocoPhillips' Q3 performance was exceptional, with notably improved metrics. The company achieved a post-Concho baseline, successfully integrating the acquisition ahead of schedule and capturing $1 billion in synergies. Despite inflation pressures, capital expenditures are anticipated to remain within the range guided in June, excluding the impact of the Shell acquisition. Adjusted earnings per share reached $1.77, surpassing consensus estimates due to higher Brent prices and lower-than-expected depreciation, depletion, and amortization. The company's triple mandate of reducing costs, lowering emissions, and improving returns on capital employed continues to progress, with trailing 12-month ROE approaching 14% by year-end. ConocoPhillips remains bullish on the sector and anticipates relative success due to its competitive cost of supply, strong returns, and progress in lowering emissions intensity.
