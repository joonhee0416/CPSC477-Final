CF Industries reported adjusted EBITDA of $1 billion for the first nine months of 2020, similar to their 2018 performance. Despite lower nitrogen prices offset by decreased natural gas and SG&A costs, the company remains optimistic about the upcoming year. Strong global demand and widening energy spreads are anticipated to support free cash flow generation. CF Industries has a strategic focus on clean hydrogen and ammonia projects and recently announced a green ammonia project at Donaldsonville. The company is well-positioned to capitalize on the growth platform of hydrogen as a clean energy source due to its position as the world's largest producer of ammonia. The company's commitment to safety has remained strong, achieving a new recordable incident rate of 0.17 incidents per 200,000 labor hours. Despite the pandemic, the company has not experienced any known COVID-19 transmissions within its locations.
