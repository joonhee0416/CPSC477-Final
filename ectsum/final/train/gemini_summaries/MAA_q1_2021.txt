MAA reported a strong Q1 with core FFO per share of $1.64, exceeding expectations by $0.05. The recovery in Sunbelt economies and job growth is driving demand, resulting in a 16% increase in leasing volume and a blended pricing increase of 2.7%. Effective rent growth reached 1.3% year-over-year. Occupancy remained strong at 95.7%, while rent collections were at 99.1%. Anticipated new supply levels remain unchanged, with deliveries expected to decline later this year and into 2022. Despite winter storm Uri's impact, net earnings were only affected by $765,000.
