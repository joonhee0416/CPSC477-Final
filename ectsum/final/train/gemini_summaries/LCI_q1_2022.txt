Lannett's financial results for the first quarter of 2022 showed a top line above expectations, driven by strong sales of key products, while the bottom line met expectations. Despite this, the company's gross margin was lower than anticipated due to competitive pressures on its base portfolio. In response to the challenging market environment, Lannett has revised its fiscal 2022 guidance and announced a restructuring plan to consolidate its manufacturing footprint and streamline its R&D function. This plan is expected to reduce expenses by $20 million annually, leading to a leaner and more focused organization. Additionally, Lannett's cash position increased to $105 million as of September 30, 2021, providing financial flexibility. The company is optimistic about its future prospects, with several durable assets in its pipeline, including a pending generic ADVAIR DISKUS ANDA, and plans to submit an IND application for biosimilar insulin glargine next month.
