ITW reported strong Q3 results with 8% revenue growth, organic growth of 6%, and EPS of $2.02, up 10%. Organic growth was led by welding (+22%), food equipment (+19%), and test & measurement (+12%). Despite challenges in the automotive OEM segment due to supply chain disruptions, ITW fully offset input cost increases with price adjustments. The company raised its full-year guidance, forecasting revenue growth of 13%-14%, organic growth of 11%-12%, and earnings growth of 27%. Despite increased raw material costs, ITW expects to maintain margins at 24% through volume leverage and enterprise initiatives. With continued strong demand and the expectation of a recovery in automotive OEM, ITW remains well-positioned for future growth and expects a record year with double-digit organic growth and margin expansion.
