Despite the challenges of 2020, MFA Financial reported $0.17 per share of earnings in Q3, largely driven by gains in whole loan values and credit reserve reversals. Liability management efforts have led to substantial progress in replacing high-cost debt with more durable and cheaper securitized debt, lowering its cost of funds by 165-180 basis points. Additionally, MFA has paid off its $500 million loan from Apollo and Athene, reducing annualized expenses by $0.03 per share. The company's residential whole loan portfolio has appreciated significantly, leading to book value growth. To enhance its earnings capability, MFA has authorized a $250 million stock repurchase program, reflecting a significant discount to its economic book value. Despite economic uncertainty, the company is well-positioned with a strong balance sheet and a strategy to take advantage of opportunities that arise.
