Sysco reported strong sales growth of 10.5% versus 2019, exceeding market growth by over 1.2 times. However, elevated operating expenses due to COVID-related labor and transportation costs resulted in lower-than-expected earnings per share of $0.57. Despite these challenges, Sysco continues to gain market share and is confident in its Recipe for Growth strategy. The company is investing in programs such as Sysco Your Way and Italian cuisine expansion to enhance its offerings and win in specialty sectors. While the impact of Omicron on demand and expenses is expected to continue into the third quarter, Sysco expects to resume volume growth and improve operating expenses in the future. Long-term, the company reaffirms its guidance of adjusted earnings per share growth of at least 30% over its record 2019 earnings by fiscal 2024.
