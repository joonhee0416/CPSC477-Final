A.O. Smith's performance in 2020 exceeded expectations with adjusted earnings of $351 million ($2.16 per share), despite a 3% decline in sales due to weakness in China. North America water treatment grew 14% organically, driven by consumer demand for safe home products, while U.S. residential water heater industry shipments surged 8% to a record high of 10 million units. Commercial water heater and boiler industry volumes declined by 8-10%, but the company maintained its market share in both categories. China demand improved throughout 2020, and the company achieved high single-digit margins in the second half of the year due to increased volumes and cost-cutting measures. For 2021, the company expects sales growth of approximately 10%, with strong growth in water treatment and China sales offsetting expected weaker North America water heater volumes. It projects North America segment margins of 23-23.5% and Rest of World segment margins of 7-8%. The company remains optimistic about its prospects for 2021, citing its leading market positions, strong cash flow, and opportunities in North America water treatment and in China and India.
