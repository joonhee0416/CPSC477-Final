In 2020, Insperity's financial performance remained resilient despite the pandemic, with adjusted EBITDA increasing by 15% and worksite employees declining by less than 1%. This resilience is attributed to the company's focus on providing high-quality HR services and its strong client base.

Looking ahead to 2021, Insperity expects a solid year of growth. Sales momentum from the fall campaign and improvements in sales efficiency are expected to drive growth in paid worksite employees. The company also plans to invest in technology and marketing initiatives to enhance its service offerings and attract new clients.

Despite some expected normalization of direct cost programs and an increase in unemployment tax rates, Insperity is confident that its pricing strength will enable it to maintain a healthy gross profit margin. The company's operating costs are expected to increase slightly, but it will continue to invest in strategic initiatives to support long-term growth.

Overall, Insperity is optimistic about the future and believes it is well-positioned to capitalize on the rebounding economy and deliver consistent growth for its shareholders. The company's focus on client satisfaction and its commitment to delivering value position it to succeed in the post-pandemic recovery.
