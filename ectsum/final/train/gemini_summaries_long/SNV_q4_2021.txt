Synovus experienced significant growth in 2021, driven by strategic initiatives and strong execution. Commercial loan growth of 50% versus 2020 and 40% versus 2019 highlights the success of these initiatives. The company's core business lines contributed to performance, with core transaction deposit growth of 57% in the past two years. Excluding security gains, non-interest revenues grew 5%, led by increases in core banking fees and wealth business income. Synovus forward initiatives achieved $110 million in pre-tax run-rate benefit, allowing for strategic investments while managing expenses. For Q4, loan growth increased $1.4 billion (14% annualized) excluding PPP, driven by record-funded commercial loan production. Core transaction deposit growth also reached $1.3 billion (4% versus Q3). NII increased $16 million from Q3, excluding PPP fee reduction, with NIM declining five basis points due to lower PPP income. Excluding PPP fees, NIM increased one basis point. Adjusted EPS for Q4 was $1.35, up from $1.08 in the same period in 2020. Looking forward to 2022, the company expects loan growth of 4-7% (excluding PPP balances) and adjusted revenue growth of 4-7%, in line with rate expectations. Adjusted expense growth is projected at 2-5%, driven by compensation increases and strategic investments. The company extended its targeted CET1 ratio range to 9.25-9.75% to support growth objectives while maintaining resilience. Overall, Synovus enters 2022 with a strong momentum and is well-positioned to deliver on its business and financial targets.
