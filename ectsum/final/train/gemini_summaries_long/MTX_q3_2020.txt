In Q3 2020, the company reported strong financial performance despite ongoing COVID-19 challenges. Total sales reached $388 million, up 9% sequentially and driven by improvements in several end markets. Metalcasting, Pet Care, and Paper PCC saw particularly strong growth, with sales in China increasing 18% for Paper PCC. The company also benefited from continued pricing and productivity actions, leading to improved operating and EBITDA margins. Despite project-oriented businesses experiencing some delays, the positive momentum across other segments is expected to continue. The company's financial position remains strong, with cash from operations at $54 million and a net leverage ratio of 2.1 times EBITDA. Looking ahead, the company anticipates similar sales in Q4 as Q3 due to offsetting factors. However, margins may be seasonally impacted by higher mining and energy costs. Overall, the company remains optimistic about its growth prospects in 2021, leveraging its strong foundation and growth initiatives.
