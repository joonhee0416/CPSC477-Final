Ecolab reported strong sales growth, reaching $3,364.6 million, an increase of 9% organically, despite a challenging global environment. Institutional and specialty segments led the growth, while industrial remained strong. However, COVID resurgences and rising inflation, with 20% cost increases in Q4, pressured margins. Ecolab anticipates inflation remaining high in the first half of 2022, easing in the second half, and expects raw material and freight costs to increase further in 2022. To mitigate costs, the company plans to enhance productivity through automation, drive innovation, and accelerate value pricing. Ecolab expects strong growth in 2022 with low-teens adjusted earnings per share growth. The first quarter is expected to have healthy sales growth but flattish earnings per share due to lingering high costs. Ecolab remains focused on long-term value, confident in its ability to overcome short-term challenges and deliver strong top line and earnings growth.
