MGM Resorts International reported strong third-quarter earnings, driven by a surge in Las Vegas Strip and regional performance. Adjusted property EBITDA records were set in both segments, led by high casino demand, effective cost management, and the acquisition of CityCenter. The Las Vegas Strip saw casino revenues increase by 26% compared to pre-pandemic levels, contributing to a 943 basis point margin improvement. Regional properties achieved all-time record EBITDAR and margin quarters, driven by increased slot and table games volume and strong rated player spend. BetMGM continued its momentum, with net revenues exceeding $227 million and a 23% share in the U.S. sports betting and iGaming market. MGM also announced several significant transactions, including the acquisition of The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas and the sale of the Mirage, to enhance its portfolio and strengthen its financial position. Despite the impact of the Delta variant on group business, MGM remains optimistic about its prospects for 2022, driven by the ongoing recovery of the industry and its strategic growth initiatives.
