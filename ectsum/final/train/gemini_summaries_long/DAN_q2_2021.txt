Dana Incorporated's Q2 financial results highlight a strong performance amidst supply chain challenges. Net sales surged by $1.1 billion to $2.2 billion, driven by customer demand outpacing production capabilities. Adjusted EBITDA improved to $233 million, but margins were affected by rising raw material costs, which are expected to continue. Despite the headwinds, the company made progress in its new business wins, securing contracts for its all-wheel-drive system and electric drivetrain systems. Dana also announced a partnership with Pierce Manufacturing for their electric Volterra platform, which has already delivered a zero-emissions pumper to the city of Madison, Wisconsin. In their commitment to sustainability, Dana has accelerated its greenhouse gas emissions reduction target by five years to 2030 and joined the Science Based Target Initiative. Management revised its full-year guidance, projecting a strong top line driven by high demand and improvements in commodity recoveries, while maintaining profit near the midpoint due to ongoing commodity cost pressures. Adjusted free cash flow is expected to improve significantly to $275 million, supported by higher profit and efficient capital allocation.
