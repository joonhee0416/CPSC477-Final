Worksite sales increased sharply year-over-year but remained below 2019 levels. The company returned $131 million to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends, marking its highest level of capital return in six years. Despite ongoing labor market challenges, CNO maintained strong retention and productivity among veteran agents. The company remains committed to prioritizing agent retention and productivity while exploring initiatives to boost new agent recruitment.
