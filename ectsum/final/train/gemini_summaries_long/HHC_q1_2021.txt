During the first quarter of 2021, Howard Hughes Corporation (HHC) reported a net loss of $67 million, equating to $1.20 per diluted share. This represents a significant improvement from the same period in 2020, when the company reported a net loss of $125 million or $2.88 per diluted share. The year-over-year improvement was primarily driven by stronger performance in the company's MPC and Strategic Developments segments, coupled with the absence of impairment charges. Despite posting a net loss, HHC's results exceeded expectations, with the company reporting a net loss of $31 million or $0.56 per diluted share when excluding non-recurring items and a loss on early debt extinguishment. Notably, HHC's first quarter performance was supported by a 35% increase in new home sales, a 44% increase in MPC earnings before tax, and continued progress in its Strategic Developments segment, particularly in Ward Village.
