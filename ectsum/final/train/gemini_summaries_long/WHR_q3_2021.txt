Despite operating in a challenging environment marked by supply chain constraints and elevated inflation, the company continued to deliver strong results. Q3 revenue grew 4% year-over-year, or 8% compared to 2019, while EBIT margins reached 11.1%, offsetting cost inflation. Earnings per share guidance was revised upward to $26.25, a 40% increase year-over-year. Looking ahead, the company expects to drive strong net sales growth of 13%, maintain EBIT margins of 10.8%, and generate $1.7 billion in adjusted free cash flow. The company's confidence in its long-term success is reflected in its increased value creation goals, including revenue growth of 5-6%, EBIT margin of 11-12%, adjusted free cash flow as a percentage of net sales of 7-8%, and return on invested capital of 15-16%. These goals are supported by positive housing and replacement demand trends, along with investments in e-commerce, digital transformation, and new ecosystems. Despite higher costs, the company's cost management and innovation efforts position it to capitalize on growth opportunities while delivering strong shareholder returns.
