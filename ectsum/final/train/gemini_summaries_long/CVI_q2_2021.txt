In Q2 2021, CVR Partners reported a net loss of $2 million, or $0.06 per share, which included a $58 million non-cash RIN mark-to-market expense. Adjusted EBITDA was $66 million for the quarter, aided by higher throughput volumes and crack spreads. The Petroleum segment had positive results due to increased throughput and elevated crack spreads, while rising RIN prices impacted margins. Despite challenges, the Fertilizer segment performed well, driven by higher UAN and ammonia prices. Looking ahead, management remains cautiously optimistic about market fundamentals but notes that further refinery closures and a rationalization of capacity are needed, especially with RIN prices continuing to distort crack spreads. Construction on the Wynnewood renewable diesel unit is progressing, but feedstock prices are currently unfavorable. The partnership paid a cash distribution of $1.72 per unit, including $7 million to CVR Energy, and ended the quarter with $519 million in cash and $652 million in liquidity.
