**Earnings Call Summary**

In Q2 2021, California Water Service Group's net income surged to $38.2 million from $5.3 million in 2020's second quarter, with earnings per share rising to $0.75 from $0.11. The company's capital investments totaled $138.5 million, up from $133.5 million in 2020. Higher revenues were primarily driven by regulatory mechanisms from a delayed General Rate Case (GRC) in 2020, which was recorded in Q3 2020.

The company experienced an unbilled revenue accrual, driven by an early surge in water consumption due to the current California drought. While this boosted Q2 earnings, it is expected to normalize over the year, contributing less to overall profits.

California Water Service Group filed its largest-ever GRC with the California Public Utilities Commission in July, requesting $1 billion in capital expenditures over three years. This rate case includes lower sales forecasts and an innovative rate design to balance customer affordability and revenue stability.

The company's recent acquisition of Texas Water Service and wastewater utilities in Texas has expanded its reach into a fast-growing region. Additionally, it has acquired water and wastewater companies in Hawaii and secured a wastewater utility acquisition on Kauai. Projected capex in 2022-2024 is estimated between $355 million and $365 million, with potential rate base increases to $2.75 billion by 2024 if the proposed GRC is approved.

The company's key focus areas include finalizing the cost of capital case, managing the 2021 General Rate Case discovery phase, mitigating the impacts of the California drought, and preparing for wildfire season.
