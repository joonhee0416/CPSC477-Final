Despite COVID-19 challenges, Mettler Toledo experienced solid growth in Q4 2020. Local currency sales increased 7%, with strong performances in Laboratory (12%) and Core Industrial (5%). The company benefited from pandemic-related tailwinds in pipette sales (1-2% boost) and cost control measures, leading to a 14% rise in adjusted operating profit and a 19% increase in adjusted EPS to $9.26.

For 2021, Mettler Toledo anticipates local currency sales growth of 5-7% and adjusted EPS growth of 14-16% to $29.20-$29.80. This outlook is driven by continued momentum, sales and marketing execution, product launches, and margin improvement initiatives. The company expects the first half of 2021 to be stronger than the second half, due to easier comparisons and COVID tailwinds, which will turn into headwinds later in the year.
