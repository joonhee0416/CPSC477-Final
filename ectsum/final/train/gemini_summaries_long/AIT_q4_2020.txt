Applied Industrial Technologies' fiscal fourth quarter saw a 17.9% decrease in consolidated sales, with a 18.4% organic decline. Organic sales in the service center segment declined 21.1%, primarily due to reduced MRO needs from COVID-19 precautions. The fluid power and flow control segment faced an 11.8% organic sales decline. However, gross margin declined only 40 basis points year-over-year, and selling, distribution, and administrative expenses fell 13.8%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 8.9%, down slightly from the prior year quarter. Strong cash flow performance resulted in $127.1 million in operating cash flow and $277 million in free cash flow for the full year. Despite the challenging environment, Applied is optimistic about the year ahead, citing initial signs of recovery, greater quoting activity, and cross-selling opportunities. The company is targeting high teen decremental margins in the near term and expects year-over-year sales declines to persist until the second half of the fiscal year. Applied remains committed to its long-term financial targets of $4.5 billion in sales and 11% EBITDA margins.
