Pitney Bowes reported remarkable fourth-quarter performance, with revenue growing 23% at constant currency, showcasing the company's highest organic growth rate on record. Notably, shipping-related revenues comprised 54% of total revenue, with Global Ecommerce delivering exceptional 60% growth and positive EBITDA. Presort Services and SendTech both reported flat revenue, indicating significant improvement from previous quarters. SendTech's transformation is noteworthy, as it turned in strong performance despite a challenging mail market, leveraging its growth in shipping-related revenue. For the full year, revenue grew 11% at constant currency, and free cash flow increased by $91 million. In 2021, the company anticipates low-to-mid single-digit revenue growth and earnings growth, with Global E-commerce projected to grow in the low double-digit range. However, headwinds such as higher employee costs and a higher tax rate will impact the overall financial results.
