American Assets Trust reported FFO of $0.56 per share and net income of $0.20 per share for Q1 2020. Despite a strong balance sheet and liquidity ($402 million), the Board reduced the dividend from $0.30 to $0.20 per share due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The decision was based on a calculation that applied the percentage of April rent collected in each sector (office, retail, multifamily, hotel) to the cash net operating income. Retail, which comprises 31% of cash NOI, has been the most impacted with 47% of April rents collected. Office, however, has performed well with 94% of April rents collected. The company remains well-prepared with a strong balance sheet (leverage of 5.6x net debt-to-EBITDA) and has options to extend its $100 million term loan up to three times. Despite the challenges, the company continues to drive brand and stabilize its office portfolio, which remains 94% leased.
