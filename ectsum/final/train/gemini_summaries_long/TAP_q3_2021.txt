Molson Coors has made significant progress in its revitalization plan and is on track to meet its 2021 financial guidance. Notably, Coors Light has grown its share of the US beer market for the first time in over five years. The company's above-premium portfolio now accounts for over 25% of its brand volume net sales revenue, driven by strong growth in hard seltzers, including Vizzy and Topo Chico. Molson Coors has also expanded beyond beer with nearly two million cases of non-alcohol beverages sold in the US, including Zoa and La Colombe.

Despite challenges in the global supply chain, the company is seeing improvements in brewery output and expects to ship approximately one million barrels per week in the US during the fourth quarter. Transportation costs and driver shortages have led to higher inflation, which is expected to continue to be a pressure point. However, Molson Coors is taking steps to mitigate these impacts, such as increasing shipping on rail.

Molson Coors is focused on premiumization and has deprioritized lower-margin SKUs, leading to a decrease in volume. However, net sales revenue per hectoliter has increased, demonstrating the company's ability to generate higher revenue despite lower volume. The company's European business has bounced back and is reaching 2019 revenue levels, driven by strong on-premise sales. Molson Coors remains optimistic about the future and expects to continue investing in its brands and innovation.
