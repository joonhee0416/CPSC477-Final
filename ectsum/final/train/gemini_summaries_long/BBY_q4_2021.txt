Best Buy reported strong fiscal 2022 results, with record revenue and earnings per share. The company's comparable sales growth was 10.4%, on top of a very strong 9.7% last year, growing $8 billion over the past two years. Non-GAAP earnings per share were just over $10, up 27% compared to last year. And compared to two years ago, Best Buy expanded its non-GAAP operating income rate by 110 basis points. Best Buy's non-GAAP return on investment improved 840 basis points compared to two years ago, and it drove more than $6.5 billion of free cash flow in the last two years. In fiscal 2022, Best Buy returned $4.2 billion of that to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. 

In Q4, Best Buy's revenue was $16.4 billion. Its domestic comparable sales declined 2.1%, and its enterprise comp sales declined 2.3%. Revenue grew 8% versus two years ago. It was only slightly below the low end of its revenue guidance for the quarter due to a few factors. The first factor was inventory availability, which was more constrained than anticipated within a few categories and brands. These constraints included some high-demand holiday items, and the categories most impacted were mobile phones and computing. The second factor impacting Best Buy's results was Omicron, which led to a temporary reduction in store hours in January and to start fiscal 2023. In mid-February, Best Buy's staffing levels started to improve, and it increased store operating hours for the majority of its stores. 

Best Buy is deliberately investing in its future and furthering its competitive differentiation. This, as expected, is temporarily impacting its profitability. The biggest areas of investment in Q4 were its new membership program, technology, and Best Buy Health, all core to its future growth potential. 

Looking ahead, Best Buy expects fiscal 2023 revenue in the range of $53.5 billion to $56.5 billion. This reflects a three-year compound annual growth rate of approximately 1% to 3%, despite the anticipated decline in sales in fiscal 2023. Best Buy also expects to expand its operating income rate to a range of 6.3% to 6.8%.
