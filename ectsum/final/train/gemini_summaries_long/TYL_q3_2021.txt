Tyler Technologies experienced exceptional third-quarter results, marking a record-breaking quarter. Total revenues surged 60.9% to $460.6 million, with organic growth of 7.5%. Subscription revenues saw a remarkable 183.3% increase, showcasing the company's transition to a cloud-first approach. Despite lower-margin revenues and expenses, the non-GAAP operating margin reached 25.3%, excluding NIC's COVID initiative revenues. Bookings hit a record of $601 million, with 51.9% organic growth excluding NIC. Subscription contract value accounted for 74% of new software contract value, reflecting the ongoing shift to cloud-based solutions. ARR grew 79.2% to $1.5 billion, driven by strong SaaS and transaction-based revenues. The company reported record cash from operations and free cash flow, with $205.4 million and $192.8 million, respectively. Despite the canceled IRS contract award, Tyler remains optimistic, with $350 billion in federal stimulus funds potentially providing a tailwind for public sector clients. The company is actively pursuing joint sales opportunities with NIC and expects continued growth in digital services and legacy system modernization.
