Aon's Q2 earnings call highlighted exceptional financial performance, with 11% organic revenue growth driven by strong contributions from all solution lines, particularly commercial risk at 14%. Adjusted earnings per share surged by 17%, while free cash flow for the first half grew by 13%. Despite the termination of the Willis Towers Watson combination, the company remains confident in its Aon United strategy, which has led to increased net new business generation and robust client retention. With a strong balance sheet and increased debt capacity, Aon expects mid-single-digit or higher organic revenue growth in 2021 and over the long term. The company's investments in innovation, such as cybersecurity organization design and digital solutions for the underserved, position it for continued growth and value creation for shareholders.
