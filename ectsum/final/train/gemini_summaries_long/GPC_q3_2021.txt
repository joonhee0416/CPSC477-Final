GPC reported a strong Q3, with total sales up 10% to $4.8 billion. The company's gross margin improved driven by strategic category management initiatives and supplier incentives, offsetting inflationary pressures. Despite rising costs, segment profit grew 14% to $447 million, resulting in a 30 basis point increase in segment margin to 9.3%, their strongest in two decades. Automotive sales set a record at $3.2 billion, with growth across all regions, particularly in the U.S. Amidst supply chain disruptions, GPC's global sourcing team effectively managed inventory levels. Industrial sales also saw a 15% increase to $1.6 billion, driven by growth across various sectors. GPC's strategic initiatives, such as innovative sales programs and omni-channel investments, contributed to strong customer demand and sales growth. The company's fiscal discipline and strong cash flow position them well for future organic and acquisitive growth, as well as returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. With the pandemic subsiding and solid business fundamentals, GPC is optimistic about its outlook for the upcoming year.
