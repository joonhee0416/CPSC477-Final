Prologis reported a strong first quarter with core FFO of $0.97 per share, exceeding expectations. Demand for logistics space remains robust, driven by the economic recovery, retail expansion, and increased inventory levels. Lease signings reached a record high of 60 million square feet, with new leasing accounting for a significant portion. As a result, the portfolio occupancy rate rose to 96.4%, and vacancies in key markets remain below 2%. The company anticipates record net absorption in the U.S. in 2021, at 300 million square feet, despite projected supply of the same magnitude. Rising replacement costs and strong demand are leading to increased pricing power, with rent growth forecast to reach 6.5% in the U.S. and 6% globally. The value of Prologis' portfolio has increased by over $10 billion in the past two quarters, driven by a 7.5% increase in asset values. The company's strong financial position includes a liquidity and combined leverage capacity of $14 billion. Prologis has revised its guidance for 2021, increasing its core FFO midpoint to $3.96 per share and raising its cash same-store NOI growth midpoint to 4.75%.
