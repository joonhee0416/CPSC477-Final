Despite challenges from supply chain issues and the ongoing pandemic, Manitowoc experienced solid growth in the first quarter, with orders increasing by 26% and the backlog rising to $663 million. The increase in tower crane orders, particularly in Europe, was attributed to tax incentives, dealer orders, and price adjustments. However, mobile crane orders in Europe were less robust, reflecting cautious economic sentiment. Encouraging activity in the Middle East and Asia Pacific contributed to overall growth, although North American orders remained steady despite positive signs in the market. To address supply chain disruptions, the company is implementing operational improvements in Italy and investing in technology, such as Grove Connect, to enhance serviceability. Additionally, Manitowoc plans to expand its European tower crane rental fleet and invest in new all-terrain crane models. Despite inflationary pressures and supply chain complications, the company anticipates adjusted EBITDA of $90-$105 million for 2021, supported by its growth strategy and transition efforts.
