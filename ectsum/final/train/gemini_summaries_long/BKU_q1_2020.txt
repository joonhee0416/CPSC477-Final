Despite the economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BankUnited's balance sheet remains strong with capital levels exceeding well-capitalized thresholds. The bank has prioritized risk management and credit quality, identifying portfolios under increased stress. They have reached out to borrowers in these segments and conducted stress testing to assess potential losses. BankUnited has implemented a large provision of $125 million, resulting in a net loss of $31 million for the first quarter. The provision reflects conservative estimates based on Moody's March mid-cycle pandemic baseline forecast. The bank's reserve at March 31st was 1.08% of loans, a level comparable to other banks.

The pandemic has led to a significant increase in deferral requests, with over $2 billion in commercial loans and $500 million in residential loans approved for modifications. BankUnited has received high deferral requests from borrowers in the commercial real estate (especially hotels and retail), franchise finance, and C&I portfolios. However, modification requests have slowed in the past 10 to 15 days.

The bank has taken a conservative approach to its available-for-sale securities portfolio, stressing the entire nonagency portfolio at the individual security level and modeling collateral losses consistent with the 2008 global financial crisis. Despite a net unrealized loss of $250 million at March 31st, valuations have started to recover. The unrealized losses have impacted other comprehensive income and GAAP capital but do not affect regulatory capital.

BankUnited has suspended its share buyback program and maintained its dividend while increasing its liquidity position. The bank has waived select fees and temporarily halted new residential foreclosure actions. Despite the uncertain economic environment, BankUnited expects growth in PPP loans and remains committed to reducing deposit costs. The bank continues to focus on its long-term strategic objectives while navigating the immediate economic crisis.
