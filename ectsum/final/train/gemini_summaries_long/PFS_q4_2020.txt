Despite the integration of SB One, Provident Financial (PFS) performed well in Q4, reporting earnings of $40.6 million ($0.53 per share), surpassing both expense savings and merger-related charge projections. Net interest income increased by 22% quarter-over-quarter due to non-interest bearing deposit growth and reduced funding costs. Total assets stood at $12.9 billion with an annualized return on average assets of 1.25% and a 14.1% return on average tangible equity. The bank's loan-to-deposit ratio was 99.8% and deposits increased $2.7 billion during the year. Credit line usage remained low at 41.6% and non-performing assets increased to 71 basis points. PFS saw a decline in non-accrual loans and charge-offs, with most clients resuming full payments after deferrals. The bank has authorized a new 5% share repurchase program and remains open to acquisition opportunities that align with its strategic objectives. Despite economic uncertainty, PFS anticipates potential for economic activity expansion in the second half of the year, especially with additional government stimulus.
