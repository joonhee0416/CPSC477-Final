In Q2, Lowe's reported strong performance with EPS of $4.25, a 13% increase. Key drivers included a 21% increase in Pro business, a 7% increase in Lowes.com sales, and double-digit growth in installation services. Despite a decline in DIY demand, Lowe's leveraged its total home strategy to capitalize on Pro demand, leading to a 49% two-year growth in this sector. The company's focus on Pro customers included a store reset project and online enhancements. Additionally, Lowe's announced the completion of its Florida region market-based delivery model for big and bulky products, resulting in higher sales and profitability. Despite lumber price volatility, Lowe's enhanced pricing systems and vendor management effectively mitigated the impact on product margins. The company expects gross margin rate to be slightly up for the full year despite a drop in lumber prices. Looking ahead, Lowe's anticipates continued growth in the home improvement market, benefits from its total home strategy, and an operating income margin of 12.2% for the full year.
