Insperity's Q3 financial results exceeded expectations, driven by strong worksite employee growth, revenue gains, and favorable pricing. The company's mature sales team and increasing sales efficiency contributed to a 20% increase in new client sales, while client retention remained at an elevated level, excluding the loss of a large client in Q1. Looking ahead, Insperity anticipates accelerated employee growth in Q4 and 2022, leveraging its strong sales momentum and the favorable labor market. While normalization of pandemic-related costs may impact gross profit in 2022, the company's underlying growth plan and high demand for its services provide a compelling long-term opportunity. Insperity intends to capitalize on the post-COVID validation of HR services, changes in workplace dynamics, and the challenges faced by small and medium businesses in this environment.
