Assurant's second quarter results demonstrate strong growth in its Lifestyle and Housing businesses. Net operating income per share (excluding catastrophes) increased 12%, year-over-year, to $2.99. Global Automotive and Multifamily Housing drove growth, while connected living faced challenges. The company expects net operating income growth of 10-14% for 2021, despite lower corporate earnings in the second half due to increased investments and lower net investment income. Assurant has completed the sale of Global Preneed and expects to use the proceeds for share buybacks, enhancements to its operations, and strategic investments. The company remains focused on innovation and customer experience, particularly in the emerging connected world landscape.
