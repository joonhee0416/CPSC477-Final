Riding the wave of strong customer relationships and an asset-light business model, Roper Technologies delivered a strong performance in 2020 despite market headwinds. Organic revenues grew 3%, and cash flow grew a remarkable 16% to $1.7 billion. This excellent cash generation was driven by improved working capital performance and contributions from the Vertafore acquisition and others. The software-focused portfolio, with 66% of EBITDA coming from software, has enhanced the quality of the enterprise with higher levels of recurring revenue and reduced exposure to cyclical end markets. For 2021, Roper expects strong growth in revenue (mid-teens) and EBITDA (mid-double digits), with organic revenue growth in the mid-single digits plus range. This growth is anticipated across all segments, with mid single-digit organic growth in both Application Software (driven by strong recurring revenue) and Network Software & Systems (led by TransCore's New York project completion and recovering tag sales). The Measurement & Analytical Solutions segment is also expected to grow mid single-digits due to Verathon's continued success and Neptune's easing restrictions. Industrial and Process Technologies are expected to recover and grow in the high single-digit plus range after two years of declines.
