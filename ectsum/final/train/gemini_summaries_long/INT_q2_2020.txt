Despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, World Fuel reported better-than-expected second-quarter results. Adjusted net income and earnings per share were $8 million and $0.13, respectively. Aviation volumes declined due to reduced passenger activity, but increased cargo and unscheduled aircraft activity partially offset the impact. Marine activity held steady, while land business benefited from increased gasoline and diesel sales. Operating expenses decreased sequentially, driven by cost-cutting measures, including a global hiring freeze and office footprint rationalization. The company generated $236 million of cash flow from operations, maintaining total available liquidity above $1 billion. World Fuel expects continued challenges in aviation but anticipates modest growth in marine and land segments. The company also announced the sale of its multi-service payment solutions business to enhance its focus on core businesses.
