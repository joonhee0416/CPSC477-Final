Helmerich & Payne reported a quarterly loss of $0.66 per share, with an adjusted loss per share of $0.82. The company attributes the loss to a rise in total direct operating costs and an increase in general and administrative expenses. The corresponding quarter the prior year saw a loss per share of $0.55. Despite the loss, Helmerich & Payne's revenues increased to $246 million due to the resumption of drilling activity in the North America Solutions segment. Notably, the company has 94 rigs contracted and running, with an estimated 630 super-spec rigs available in the U.S. market. With optimistic market expectations for U.S. production growth, the company anticipates the industry rig count to reach 500 active rigs by year-end. Helmerich & Payne remains focused on deploying technology solutions, implementing performance-based contracts, and reducing costs to enhance its long-term position.
