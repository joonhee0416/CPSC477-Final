Despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, Teradata delivered strong results in Q2, exceeding expectations on key metrics. Strong sales execution and cost discipline led to robust ARR growth, significant free cash flow, and solid earnings per share. The company highlighted its focus on technology innovation, particularly in the cloud, with the release of Vantage with Native Object Store support, enabling greater data usage and analytics insights. Teradata also emphasized the importance of customer success, modernizing its go-to-market motions and rolling out a customer success program to enhance customer value. Cloud wins included notable partnerships with Vodafone, a major U.S. supermarket chain, a European energy company, a global gaming and hospitality firm, a leading U.S. wholesaler, a large Canadian retailer, and others. Despite uncertainties in the second half due to the pandemic, Teradata remains cautiously optimistic based on its strong pipeline and the resilience of its customer base, with less than 12% of revenue coming from heavily impacted industries.
