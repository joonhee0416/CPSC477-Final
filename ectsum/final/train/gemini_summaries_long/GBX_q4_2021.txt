Greenbrier's fiscal fourth quarter marked their strongest quarter of the year, with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.33 and increased new railcar order activity. They delivered 4,500 railcars, including 400 in Brazil, representing a 36% increase from Q3. The company has successfully ramped up production lines, and their leasing fleet continues to grow, with the recent acquisition of 3,600 railcars. Greenbrier's strategy shift, focusing on technology, diversification, and services, aims to stabilize business cycles and foster future growth. Despite challenges like supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, the company remains optimistic about fiscal 2022, projecting deliveries between 16,000 to 18,000 units. The company's enhanced leasing strategy will provide revenue and tax-advantaged cash flow, mitigating the cyclicality of railcar production. Greenbrier's strong financial position, with liquidity of $835 million, ensures their ability to navigate these challenges.
