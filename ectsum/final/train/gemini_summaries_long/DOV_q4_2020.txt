Dover Corporation's earnings call highlighted a stable Q4 with flat revenue and adjusted segment operating margin. Notably, the year-over-year backlog increased by 21% due to general recovery trends, a surge in DFRE segment backlog, and proactive preorders driven by rising raw material costs and supply chain concerns. Despite revenue remaining unchanged, adjusted segment margins improved in 2020, primarily due to structural cost savings and tight cost controls. Full-year free cash flow increased by 24% to $939 million, driven by working capital liquidations and efficiency gains. Looking ahead to 2021, Dover anticipates 5-6% organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings per share of $6.25 to $6.45, supported by a solid order book and positive market trends in several segments. The company emphasized its commitment to margin improvement, investing in strategic initiatives to drive productivity and efficiency. Dover also discussed the progress of its enterprise capabilities, highlighting investments in digital commerce, operational excellence, central back office systems, and innovation. The company remains optimistic about its through-cycle growth profile and shareholder-friendly capital allocation strategy.
