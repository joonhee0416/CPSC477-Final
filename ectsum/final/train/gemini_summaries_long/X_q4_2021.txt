U.S. Steel achieved record financial performance in 2021, with $5.6 billion in adjusted EBITDA, 28% margin, and $3.2 billion in free cash flow. The company's strong balance sheet and strategic investments in mini mill expansion and other capabilities are expected to drive continued growth in 2022. Despite seasonal headwinds in Q1, U.S. Steel believes in strong consumer demand, easing supply chain issues, and positive price momentum. The company is committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet, investing in capabilities to enhance competitive advantages, and returning capital to stockholders through dividends and stock buybacks. With a target debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3 to 3.5 times, U.S. Steel plans to fund strategic projects while optimizing its capital structure and preserving its ability to distribute cash to investors. The company is confident in its "best for all" strategy, which aims to create long-term stockholder value through a balanced approach to financial strength, earnings growth, and capital returns.
