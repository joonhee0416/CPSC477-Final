Despite strong presold orders and high demand, Polaris faced supply chain challenges in Q3, resulting in a 24% decline in North American retail sales. While the company met earnings expectations, sales finished below projections due to logistics issues and supplier shortages. The ORV segment remains resilient, gaining market share despite supply constraints. However, motorcycles, snowmobiles, and boats saw decreased sales. Dealer inventory levels remain at record lows, down 75% from pre-COVID levels. Polaris has taken steps to improve communication and visibility for dealers and consumers regarding presold orders, including an industry-first online order tracker. The company also faces higher input costs due to supply chain disruptions, which have increased by fivefold since the beginning of the year. Despite these challenges, Polaris maintains a strong balance sheet and has made significant investments in capacity expansion. While the supply chain is expected to remain challenging in 2022, the company anticipates healthy consumer demand and believes it is well-positioned to capitalize on it when the supply chain normalizes.
