In Q3'21, Frontline posted a net loss of $33.2 million or $0.17 per share, impacted by lower TCE rates. However, the tanker market has recovered since then, with Q4'21 spot TCE estimates showing a significant increase for VLCCs ($21,600), Suezmax ($17,900), and LR2 ($16,000). Despite challenges due to Omicron, demand for freight increased towards the end of Q3, boosted by export volume growth. Frontline's financial commitments are fully funded with reduced costs, offering leverage during market strength and protecting cash flow during weakness. The company has also extended its revolving credit facility to May 2023, eliminating loan maturities until then. Notably, tanker recycling has accelerated, with 2% of the global fleet sold for demolition in 2021, potentially reducing vessel supply.
