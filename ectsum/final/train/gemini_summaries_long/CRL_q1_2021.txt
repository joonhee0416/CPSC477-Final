Charles River's Q1 2021 performance exceeded expectations, marked by 13% organic revenue growth and 170 basis points of operating margin improvement. The strong performance was driven by increased demand for outsourcing solutions and Charles River's enhanced scientific capabilities. All three segments reported double-digit organic revenue growth, with Safety Assessment seeing record bookings and proposal levels. The company's recent acquisitions, including Cognate BioServices, Distributed Bio, and Retrogenix, are expected to further strengthen its portfolio and support growth in high-science areas such as cell and gene therapy. Based on the strong start to the year and positive outlook, Charles River has increased its 2021 guidance, expecting reported revenue growth of 19%-21% and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $9.75-$10.00. The company anticipates continued strong demand and operating margin improvement throughout the year, approaching 21%.
