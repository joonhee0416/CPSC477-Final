Oxford Industries delivered consistent consolidated financial results in fiscal 2019, primarily driven by growth in its direct businesses, including double-digit growth in e-commerce, which now accounts for 23% of sales. However, wholesale sales declined due to challenges faced by retail partners. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, Oxford has temporarily closed all its North American stores and restaurants and implemented safety measures in its distribution centers. Preserving employee health and well-being, protecting brand strength, and maintaining liquidity are the company's top priorities. To mitigate inventory risks, Oxford is collaborating with suppliers and leveraging its digital presence. The company has also bolstered its liquidity by drawing down $200 million from its credit facility. Expense reduction measures include furloughs and layoffs, negotiations with landlords, reductions in marketing and variable expenses, and deferrals of capital expenditures. The Board of Directors has reduced the quarterly dividend to maintain liquidity. Despite the current challenges, Oxford remains confident in its ability to navigate these unprecedented times through the strength of its people, brands, and financial position.
