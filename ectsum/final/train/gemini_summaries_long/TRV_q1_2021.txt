Travelers Companies reported strong financial results for the first quarter, demonstrating the effectiveness of their underwriting and investment strategies. Core income reached $699 million, representing an increase driven by favorable prior year reserve development, strong underlying underwriting income, and higher net investment income. Despite severe winter weather leading to record catastrophe losses, the company maintained discipline in pricing and risk selection. Underlying underwriting income improved due to earned pricing exceeding loss cost trends in commercial businesses and favorable loss conditions in personal auto. Net written premiums grew by 2%, driven by strong renewal premium changes in each business segment. Personal Insurance experienced excellent growth with new business increasing by 17% year-over-year. The company also announced a 4% increase in quarterly dividend and authorized an additional $5 billion for share repurchases, reflecting confidence in their financial position and business prospects. Overall, Travelers' strong execution and disciplined underwriting position them well to capitalize on opportunities as the economy recovers.
