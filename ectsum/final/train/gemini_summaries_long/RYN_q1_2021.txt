Rayonier's Q1 results were positive, with adjusted EBITDA of $70 million exceeding the prior year by 47%. The Southern Timber segment saw a slight decline in adjusted EBITDA due to lower harvest volumes, while the Pacific Northwest and New Zealand Timber segments experienced strong growth due to increased log pricing and demand. The Real Estate segment contributed $5 million in adjusted EBITDA, driven by higher acres sold and weighted average prices. Despite a light first quarter for real estate closings, the company expects a significant increase in EBITDA from this segment over the next few quarters. Rayonier remains optimistic about achieving full-year adjusted EBITDA toward the upper end of its guidance range of $285 million to $315 million, fueled by strong volume expectations in all timber segments and a pickup in real estate closings.
