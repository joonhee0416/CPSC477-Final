Despite challenges faced by the industry, RPT experienced strong leasing activity and rent collections in Q3. They signed 106,000 square feet of new leases, the highest since 2019, and have a $1.5 million ABR in advanced negotiation stages. Demand from grocery, off-price, QSR, and medical tenants is driving leasing activity, with a notable increase from mall tenants moving to open-air centers. Releasing spreads also saw double-digit growth, including a 43% increase on new leases, the highest since 2018. Notable new leasing deals include Nike, Sephora, Burlington, and Bank of America. Notably, Bed Bath & Beyond, the fourth-largest tenant, has seen a positive turnaround with its same-day delivery service. While 3% of RPT's ABR is from theaters, the company is taking proactive measures to minimize the impact of theater closures. Overall, RPT's strong liquidity position and strategic partnerships provide them with the flexibility to play offense in acquisition opportunities.
