IGT's Q1 performance showcased impressive revenue growth, particularly in their lottery segment, which saw record sales and profits due to strong player demand. Same-store sales soared over 30% globally, with sustained strength continuing into Q2, driven by jackpot activity and innovative game offerings. The gaming segment also exhibited a swift recovery, with U.S. casino operations returning to pre-COVID levels, fueled by core player return and new player acquisition. Digital and betting revenue nearly doubled, highlighting the company's strong presence in iGaming, sports betting, and iLottery. Cost-saving initiatives under the OPtiMa program contributed significantly to the company's financial performance, leading to EBITDA growth of over 70%. IGT's strategic investments in content expansion and platform enhancements position it well for continued growth in these sectors. Key financial metrics are expected to return to pre-pandemic trends by year-end, aided by the recent sale of certain Italy B2C gaming businesses and the retirement of debt.
