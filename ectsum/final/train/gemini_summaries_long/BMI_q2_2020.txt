Despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, the company witnessed a gradual improvement in demand, particularly in municipal water, which saw a 9% sales decrease. Order delays and supply chain disruptions eased throughout the quarter, while manufacturing disruptions and employee absenteeism impacted output. Gross margin increased to 39.3%, driven by cost-cutting measures, positive sales mix, and lower commodity costs. Earnings per share declined 15% to $0.33, but the company maintained a strong financial position with $85 million in cash and an untapped credit facility of $125 million. Looking ahead, the company anticipates a protracted economic recovery but remains optimistic about its ability to adapt. It plans to invest in new products, enhance manufacturing processes, and consider strategic acquisitions to expand its offerings in essential markets.
