Valero Energy reported a net loss in Q1 2021 due to excess energy costs from Winter Storm Uri but saw improvements in its refining business. Refining margins improved significantly due to increased demand and lower product inventories. The renewable diesel segment set records for operating income and product margin, while wholesale operations expanded into Mexico. Valero is investing heavily in renewable fuels and carbon capture projects, including the Diamond Green Diesel 2 project expected to come online in Q4 2021. The company anticipates continued improvement in refining margins and strong demand for gasoline and diesel as travel increases. With positive operating income and operating cash flow in March, Valero remains optimistic about the future driven by its growth strategy and low-carbon initiatives.
