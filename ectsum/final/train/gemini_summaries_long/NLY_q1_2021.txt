In its Q1 earnings call, Annaly highlighted key developments and strategic realignment. Despite the impact of the commercial real estate (CRE) business sale, which resulted in a $0.05 per share goodwill impairment, the company's book value rose marginally to $8.95 per share. Excluding the impairment, the tangible economic return for the quarter was 3.6%. Annaly observed a meaningful sell-off in Treasury rates, driving appreciation in its long-duration Agency MBS portfolio. The company maintained a conservative leverage stance but expanded its residential credit portfolio through investments in mortgage servicing rights (MSR), whole loans, and securitizations. Amid the buoyant housing market, Annaly anticipates continued strong performance in residential credit for the remainder of 2021. The company's middle-market lending group saw a modest portfolio decline due to intense refinancings, but its returns improved. Annaly expects growth or contraction in this sector to be driven by underlying credit conditions and unleveraged compensation for risk. With its CRE divestiture complete, Annaly aims to enhance its operational capabilities in residential housing finance. Despite the sale, the company retains $500 million in commercial mortgage-backed securities and will consider expanding this portfolio based on pricing and outlook.
