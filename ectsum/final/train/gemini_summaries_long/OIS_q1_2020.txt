Despite recording a large headline loss in Q1 due to COVID-19-related impairments, Oil States exceeded guidance excluding these impairments. Completion Services and Downhole Technologies revenues and margins improved, while Offshore/Manufactured Products revenues declined due to project-driven sales delays. The company is amending its revolving credit facility to an asset-based lending arrangement, expecting a borrowing base of $175-$200 million. Key cost reduction measures include a 70% reduction in capex, headcount reductions in several segments, elimination of short-term incentives, and salary reductions for executive management. Overall, Oil States believes it can manage through the downturn with a strong working capital position and is committed to safe operations, providing value-added products, and managing costs to stabilize financial results.
