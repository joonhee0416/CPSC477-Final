Despite challenges presented by the pandemic and the closure of Westwood International Advisors, Westwood has recorded promising results. Their U.S. equity value strategies continue to perform well, with LargeCap Value and SMid Cap outperforming their respective benchmarks. Despite the headwinds faced by SmallCap, it remains ahead year-to-date. Multi-asset strategies have also performed exceptionally well, with Income Opportunity outperforming its benchmark. Client retention and asset stability remain high, and new business inflows remain steady. However, overall revenues declined year-over-year due to lower assets under management. The company emphasizes disciplined investment processes, a focus on alpha generation, and distribution excellence. Westwood also highlights the importance of wealth management solutions, financial technology, and operational efficiencies. With a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility, the company plans to capitalize on industry disruptions and expand its operations in the future.
