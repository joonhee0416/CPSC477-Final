Vulcan Materials reported strong 2020 results despite pandemic challenges, with EBITDA increasing 4% to $1.324 billion and cash generation rising 9% to $1.1 billion. Aggregates volume declined 3%, but higher average selling prices and cost control drove a 5.5% gain in cash gross profit per ton. Non-aggregates segments also experienced profit increases, with asphalt and ready-mix concrete unit profitability improving. Looking ahead to 2021, Vulcan expects solid earnings growth due to market opportunities in residential construction and highway construction. Aggregates shipments are expected to fluctuate between a 2% decline and a 2% increase, but unit profitability will improve. Freight-adjusted average selling prices are projected to increase 2%-4%. Non-aggregates gross profit is forecast to grow in the mid-single to mid-high single digits. Vulcan plans to invest $450-$475 million in capital expenditures, including growth projects and catch-up operating expenses. Its strong balance sheet and leading market positions provide confidence in the company's future performance.
