Boston Properties (BXP) reported strong financial results for the third quarter, with FFO per share exceeding market consensus and the midpoint of guidance. The company continues to benefit from the post-pandemic recovery in the office market, with strong leasing activity and improved occupancy rates. BXP has leased over 3.3 million square feet year-to-date with an average lease term of 8.3 years, reflecting the enhanced velocity and economics in the current marketplace for premium quality, well-amenitized assets. Key tenants continue to prioritize the office as their preferred location for collaboration, innovation, and training, despite concerns about remote work. BXP's portfolio occupancy rate continues to improve, with New York City leading the recovery at 52% occupied. The company expects a slow but gradual increase in occupancy in 2022 as new leases commence. BXP is also seeing strong capital markets activity, with $26 billion of significant office assets sold in the third quarter, up 165% from the third quarter a year ago. Cap rates are arguably declining for assets with limited lease rollover in life science-related properties due to low interest rates. BXP has completed several acquisitions and dispositions year-to-date, with more transactions expected in the future as the pandemic recedes. The company's development pipeline remains robust, with 4.3 million square feet of development underway that is 72% pre-leased. These future deliveries are projected to add approximately $190 million to NOI and 3.8% to annual NOI growth over the next few years. Looking ahead, BXP projects strong FFO per share growth of approximately 13% in 2022, driven by improving economic conditions, leasing activity, recovery of variable revenue streams, delivery of a well-leased development pipeline, completion of four new acquisitions, a strong balance sheet, and low interest rates.
