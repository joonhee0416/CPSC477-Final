EnPro reported a strong third quarter with increased sales and adjusted EBITDA margins. The company's Sealing Technologies segment saw a 15.7% increase in sales, driven by demand in petrochemical and other markets. Advanced Surface Technology sales surged by 44.2%, primarily due to growth in the semiconductor industry. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased by 39% to $1.40. EnPro has acquired NxEdge, a semiconductor manufacturing and cleaning business, for $850 million. NxEdge is expected to significantly expand EnPro's semiconductor product offerings and contribute to its growth strategy. The acquisition will be funded through a combination of cash, revolving credit facility borrowings, and term loan debt. Based on current interest rates, NxEdge is projected to increase adjusted diluted earnings per share by approximately $1.70 in 2022, representing about 30% more than the midpoint of EnPro's 2021 guidance range.
