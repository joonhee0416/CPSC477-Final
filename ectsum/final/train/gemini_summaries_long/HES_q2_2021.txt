Despite a decrease in adjusted net income due to unfavorable market conditions, Hess Corporation remains well-positioned for significant growth and shareholder value. Their strategy focuses on low-cost supply, which has placed the company among the top 5% of the S&P 500 for cash flow growth and places it at the forefront of the growing global need for reliable, affordable, and cleaner energy. The company is actively developing its high-return assets in Guyana, which is expected to drive their portfolio's breakeven Brent oil price below $40 per barrel, increasing cash flow and resilience in a low oil price environment. The company's third development in Guyana, Payara, is scheduled to produce 220,000 barrels of oil per day in 2024, strengthening their portfolio's resilience. Additionally, Hess Corporation has reduced its debt by $500 million and plans to return the majority of its increasing free cash flow to shareholders through dividend increases and share repurchases. The company remains committed to sustainability, exceeding emission targets, and investing in research to capture carbon. Despite some production challenges in the third quarter, the company maintained its guidance for key financial metrics and anticipates continued strong operational performance across its assets.
