MDC Holdings reported strong results for the third quarter of 2021, with net income of $146 million ($1.99 per diluted share) driven by revenue growth, price increases, and overhead efficiency. They have also increased their annual dividend rate to $2 per share. Home sales revenue grew 26%, with gross margins up 300 basis points to 23.5% due to pricing ahead of cost inflation. SG&A expenses also decreased by 80 basis points to 9.6%. Despite supply chain issues, order activity remained healthy at 4.1 sales per community per month. They have expanded into new markets in Boise, Nashville, Austin, and Albuquerque. MDC has a solid land position with a 37% increase in lot supply, including optioned lots. As of the quarter-end, they had a total liquidity position of $2 billion and a net debt-to-capital ratio of 23.7%. Looking ahead, they expect supply chain issues to persist but are optimistic about maintaining current demand drivers. Their focus is delivering homes and backlog while setting the stage for growth in 2022.
