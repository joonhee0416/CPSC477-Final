Regis Corporation outlined a successful amendment to its revolving credit facility, providing long-term flexibility and liquidity. Despite pandemic-related salon closures, 82% of the company's total portfolio is currently open for business. Franchise same-store sales declined 20% due to reduced traffic, and full-year adjusted EBITDA was $103 million unfavorable year over year. The company recognized a $23 million noncash long-lived asset impairment related to lease assets. Despite challenges, Regis remains committed to its strategy and has made significant investments in technology, including OpenSalon Pro and enhanced mobile apps. The company anticipates substantially completing its refranchising process by the end of fiscal year 2021, a slight delay due to the pandemic.
