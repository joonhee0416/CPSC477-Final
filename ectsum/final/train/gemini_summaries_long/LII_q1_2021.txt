Lennox International reported strong Q1 results, setting new revenue, profit, and earnings per share records across all its segments. Overall, revenue surged 29% to $931 million, driven by double-digit growth in Residential, Commercial, and Refrigeration businesses. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations grew an impressive 305% to $2.27. Adjusted earnings per share for 2021 are now forecast to be between $11.40 and $12.00, and revenue growth is expected to range from 7% to 11%. This favorable performance was attributed to operational execution, increased demand from colder winter weather, and market share gains. The company also benefited from a strong backlog and positive order rates in Commercial and Refrigeration segments. Management highlighted continued investments in innovation, expansion of the new third plant in Mexico, and plans to repurchase $400 million in stock this year.
