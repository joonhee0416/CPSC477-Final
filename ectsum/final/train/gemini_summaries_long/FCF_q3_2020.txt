The company's third quarter results demonstrated solid performance, with core earnings per share holding steady at $0.24 despite increased loan loss reserves. The core efficiency ratio reached a low of 54.45%, while the core pre-tax pre-provision ROAA improved to 1.74%. Notably, fee income hit a record high of $26.7 million, driven by strong performance across various business lines. Loan growth was led by consumer lending, which offset a decline in commercial loan utilization. A strong provision for loan losses of $11.2 million, including a $6.9 million reserve build, reflected the ongoing impact of the pandemic. Despite the reserve build and lower net interest margin due to excess liquidity, the company's strong fee income made up for the absence of PPP forgiveness income. Expense management efforts, including a voluntary early retirement program and branch consolidations, are expected to keep non-interest expenses flat in 2021. Credit quality remained solid, with net charge-offs annualized at 0.27% and non-performing loans improving to 0.78% of total loans. The company's reserve coverage ratio excluding PPP loans stands at 1.59%, providing a solid foundation ahead of CECL adoption next quarter.
