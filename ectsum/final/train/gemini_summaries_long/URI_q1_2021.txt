United Rentals, buoyed by strong customer optimism, had a robust start to 2021. Rental revenue rebounded, with March showing year-over-year growth. Used equipment sales surged by nearly 28%, driven by retail sales. Sequentially, fleet productivity improved significantly. Notably, the company's strategic investments in cold starts and acquisitions of Franklin Equipment and General Finance aim to amplify growth and meet customer needs. Specialty businesses, particularly Power & HVAC, performed strongly, with rental revenue exceeding pre-pandemic levels. Customers are upbeat, with work-in-hand and project activity recovering. The manufacturing sector's resurgence and resilience in construction verticals, such as technology, data centers, and healthcare, further support demand. Infrastructure spending, if realized, could provide long-term opportunities. Adjusted EBITDA reached $873 million, with used sales providing a tailwind. The company's capital discipline and a strong balance sheet allow it to pursue strategic investments. In light of these positive developments, United Rentals raised its guidance across revenue, EBITDA, and free cash flow, reflecting the year's promising outlook.
