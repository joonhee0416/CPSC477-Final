Despite a decline in Q2 revenue to $187.5 million, Quanex Building Products reported a net income of $5.5 million compared to a loss in the same period last year. The net sales decrease was primarily attributed to COVID-19 impacts, which began in late March with a 25% decline in April revenues. Despite volume drops, adjusted earnings remained relatively stable due to lower SG&A expenses. Notably, the North American Fenestration segment witnessed revenue growth prior to the pandemic but faced a decline in April due to COVID-19. However, the segment realized a margin expansion of approximately 100 basis points due to cost reductions. The European Fenestration segment also saw a revenue decline, mainly due to the UK lockdown that lasted until recently. The North American Cabinet Components segment experienced a 19.4% revenue decline primarily due to COVID-19 impacts, as well as the loss of a customer. Despite these challenges, Quanex remains optimistic about the second half of the year, anticipating improvements in working capital and expects to generate $30 million to $35 million in free cash flow due to seasonal trends and proactive cost management measures. The company is confident in its ability to recover, with signs of optimism in the building products industry. While revenue projections for Q3 indicate a decline, Quanex expects improvement compared to Q2 and anticipates further recovery in Q4.
