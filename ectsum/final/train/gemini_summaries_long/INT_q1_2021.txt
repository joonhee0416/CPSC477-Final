World Fuel reported strong Q1 results despite continued weakness in commercial aviation, driven by solid performance in its land segment. Adjusted EPS was $0.33 on revenue of $6 billion. Aviation volume remained low due to ongoing pandemic impacts, particularly in international commercial passenger travel, but domestic activity improved. Marine volume was flat due to the strong performance seen in Q1 2020 related to IMO 2020 regulations. Land volume increased sequentially, driven by growth in natural gas operations and improved UK heating oil business. Gross profit saw a sequential increase due to improved results in physical operations, particularly in the land segment. Total accounts receivable rose significantly due to higher fuel prices. The company ended the quarter with a net cash position of over $200 million and plans to use this capital for organic growth, strategic investments, share repurchases, and dividend payments. Despite continued challenges, World Fuel remains optimistic about its long-term prospects, citing its strong balance sheet, diversification, and commitment to sustainability initiatives.
