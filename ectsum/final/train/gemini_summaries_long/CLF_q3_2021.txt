Cleveland-Cliffs reported record Q3 revenues ($6B), net income ($1.3B), and adjusted EBITDA ($1.9B), with adjusted EBITDA rising 42% quarter-over-quarter. Celso Goncalves, the newly appointed CFO, outlined five priorities: allocating capital, maintaining financial flexibility, deleveraging, evaluating mergers and acquisitions, and outperforming peer groups. Despite increased costs and a one-time vaccination bonus payment, the company generated strong free cash flow ($1.3B), which was used entirely for share buybacks. The acquisition of FPT, a prime scrap processor, is expected to further enhance profitability and reduce carbon emissions. Prime scrap is in high demand due to the growing EAF steelmaking capacity, and Cleveland-Cliffs' access to its own prime scrap will enable it to optimize productivity and reduce emissions. Despite the addition of new flat-rolled capacity in the industry, the company maintains its leadership position in automotive steel production due to its technologically advanced capabilities. The Toledo direct reduction plant continues to exceed expectations, reducing costs and emissions. The company expects to continue debt reduction in Q4, resulting in less than one turn of net leverage. Despite the bearish futures curve, annual fixed price contracts with automotive and other clients are expected to provide downside protection and support profitability in 2022.
