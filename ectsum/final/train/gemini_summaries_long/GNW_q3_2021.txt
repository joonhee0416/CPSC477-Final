Genworth's third-quarter performance was robust, with a significant increase in adjusted operating income to $239 million, bringing the year-to-date figure to over $600 million. U.S. life's contribution grew to $93 million, primarily driven by strong LTC in-force rate actions and higher investment income. Enact's performance was also notable, with adjusted operating income of $134 million and a substantial 10% year-over-year increase in insurance in-force. Genworth retired its remaining September 2021 debt of $513 million and successfully executed Enact's IPO, generating $529 million in proceeds. The reduction in holding company debt to $1.5 billion is a significant step towards the target of approximately $1 billion. The company's strong cash position of $638 million allows for potential retirement of its 2023 debt maturity once Enact declares its dividend. Focus on strategic priorities such as economic breakeven, LTC growth initiatives, and capital return to shareholders remains a priority, with Enact's dividend stream being a key cash flow source.
