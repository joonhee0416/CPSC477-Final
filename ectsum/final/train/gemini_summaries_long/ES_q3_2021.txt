In Q3 2021, Eversource Energy reported GAAP earnings of $0.82 per share, reflecting a charge related to a Connecticut electric rate settlement and the integration of Eversource Gas of Massachusetts. Overall, the company experienced improved results in electric transmission and distribution, offset by lower results in natural gas and water segments. Storm-related expenses remained a headwind, costing $0.01 per share in Q3. Reiterating previous guidance, Eversource anticipates earnings per share growth of 5% to 7% through 2025, excluding offshore wind projects. In Connecticut, the company approved a settlement that provides $65 million in rate credits to customers, avoids a rate reduction, and extends the current ROE and capital structure. Despite inflationary pressures, Eversource plans to maintain superior service to its CL&P customers. Furthermore, in grid modernization, AMI, electric vehicle initiatives, and offshore wind projects, the company continues to invest significantly to enhance service, reliability, and environmental sustainability. Notably, Eversource expects a 15% increase in natural gas heating bills and a $0.02 to $0.03 increase in retail electric prices in Massachusetts and Connecticut due to higher natural gas prices. Despite these price increases, the company remains committed to providing energy efficiency programs and payment options to support its customers.
