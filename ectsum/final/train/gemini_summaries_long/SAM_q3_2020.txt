Boston Beer experienced a surge in third-quarter depletions, with a 36% increase attributed to the success of its Truly Hard Seltzer and Twisted Tea brands. Despite the impact of COVID-19 on its On-Premise channels, the company saw strong growth in Off-Premise sales. Looking ahead to 2021, Boston Beer forecasts depletions and shipments to increase by 35-45%, with continued investment in its Truly brand being a key focus. Gross margins are expected to remain between 46-48%, while advertising and promotional expenses are projected to rise to support brand growth. The company plans to invest heavily in capacity expansion and supply chain improvements to meet increasing demand, with capital expenditures estimated at $300-$400 million in 2021. Despite the challenges posed by competition and pandemic-related disruptions, Boston Beer remains optimistic about its long-term growth prospects and is prioritizing volume delivery over margin optimization.
