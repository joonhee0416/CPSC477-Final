United States Cellular Corporation (UScellular) experienced positive momentum in several focus areas during 2021, including prepaid, business and government, and fixed wireless. The company aims to expand its return on capital through tactical plans and expects to maintain a steady pace of capital investment in 2022. UScellular acquired valuable mid-band spectrum in recent auctions, covering 80% of its subscribers with 100 megahertz. The company has reduced its cost of financing and increased its dividend rate for the 48th consecutive year.

UScellular plans to take advantage of funds allocated through the recently passed Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which provides funding for broadband expansion. The company believes this funding will be a game-changer for connecting underserved areas, particularly in rural America. UScellular also plans to improve its digital experience and leverage its regional approach to adjust its go-to-market strategy on a community-by-community basis. The company remains optimistic about growth over the long term, aiming for substantive expansion and return on capital.
