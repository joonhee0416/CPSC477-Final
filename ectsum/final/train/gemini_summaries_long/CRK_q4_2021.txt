Comstock Resources reported strong financial results for the fourth quarter of 2021, driven by higher production, improved operational efficiency, and cost optimization. The company's shift to longer laterals, particularly the successful drilling of four 15,000-foot lateral wells, significantly enhanced well performance and reduced decline rates. This strategy, along with improved drilling performance and capital efficiencies, allowed Comstock to offset higher service costs. As a result, EBITDAX grew 41% to $297 million, and the company generated $105 million in free cash flow. Comstock's drilling inventory remains robust, with an average lateral length of 8,520 feet, providing a 25-year reserve base. The company plans to retire $479 million of debt in 2022, including redeeming its 2025 senior notes, and targets a leverage ratio of 1.5 or less. With strong financial liquidity and exceptional drilling returns, Comstock is well-positioned to generate significant free cash flow in 2022 and potentially consider returning capital to shareholders.
