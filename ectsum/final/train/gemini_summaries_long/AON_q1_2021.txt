Aon reported strong Q1 2021 results, driven by its Aon United strategy. Organic revenue grew 6%, with strength in Commercial Risk (9%), Reinsurance (6%), Retirement Solutions (5%), and Health Solutions (4%). Data and analytics experienced a 2% organic decline due to ongoing travel and events pressures. The company attributed better-than-expected growth to favorable macroeconomic conditions and client buying behavior. Looking ahead, Aon expects mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for the full year. Total expenses grew 15% due to organic revenue growth and increased operating income. A notable highlight is the development of a blockchain solution for premium accounting, which has improved efficiency and reduced errors. Aon's pending combination with Willis Towers Watson is expected to further enhance its capabilities and drive growth in innovative solutions for clients.
