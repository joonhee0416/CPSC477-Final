During the second quarter, the company witnessed a 2.3% customer growth and 5.7% weather-normalized sales growth. Despite a recommended opinion and order (ROO) from an administrative law judge on August 2nd that could decrease annual net income by $90 million if approved, the company remains optimistic. The ROO includes a denial of recovery for investments in the Four Corners SCR project and Ocotillo Modernization Project. The company plans to file exceptions to the ROO on August 23rd and will evaluate all options to ensure necessary investments are made to support customer growth. Despite the ROO, the company experienced strong earnings per share of $1.91, and sales increased due to the reopening of businesses and return to in-person work. The company maintains a strong ESG rating and is working towards achieving 100% clean energy by 2050. The local economy continues to grow, with high levels of residential housing permits and a low unemployment rate. The company's financial health remains strong, and it anticipates issuing $500 million of long-term debt to fund capital investments. Despite the challenges of the ongoing pandemic and the pending rate case resolution, the company remains committed to delivering reliable service to customers, shareholders, communities, and employees.
