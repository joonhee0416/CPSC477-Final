In 2021, Genworth Corporation achieved a notable $904 million U.S. GAAP net income, representing a significant increase from 2020's $178 million. Adjusted operating income also saw a substantial rise to $765 million compared to $310 million the previous year. The company's strong performance was driven by record results for National Transfer Account (NAT) and $520 million in adjusted operating income available to Genworth shareholders from Enact (Envoy Acquisition Corp).

Genworth's U.S. life and runoff operations performed exceptionally well, with $201 million combined adjusted operating income for the year. This was led by positive LTC (Long-Term Care) adjusted operating income of $445 million. Genworth highlighted its impressive statutory results, which are deemed important by insurance regulators. Based on preliminary data, Genworth's U.S. statutory net income is estimated at $660 million for the full year, with LTC contributing an estimated $910 million pre-tax statutory income.

The company's balance sheet also saw significant improvement. GLIC's (Genworth Life Insurance Company) consolidated statutory balance sheet strengthened with capital and surplus expected to increase from $2.1 billion in 2020 to $2.9 billion at year-end 2021. GLIC's negative unassigned surplus is projected to improve from $1.8 billion to approximately $1.0 billion. GLIC's RBC (Risk-Based Capital) ratio is estimated to rise to approximately 290 at year-end 2021, a significant increase from 229 in 2020. This improvement was primarily driven by strong statutory net income in 2021, particularly from favorable LTC results.

Genworth's progress on its strategic priorities was also highlighted. The company's first priority is to maximize the value of its equity position in Enact, which it decided to achieve through a partial IPO rather than a full sale or maintaining full ownership. This decision was driven by the expectation of significant future cash flows from Enact, allowing for deleveraging at Genworth and potential capital returns to shareholders. Genworth retains the optionality of future transactions, including a tax-free spinoff to shareholders.

Its second strategic priority was to reduce Genworth's holding company debt to approximately $1 billion. The company has significantly reduced its debt, including paying off the AXA promissory note and redeeming $400 million of parent holding company debt due in 2023. As a result, Genworth's outstanding debt is now around $1.2 billion. With $356 million in cash, the company's net debt position is already below $1 billion. Genworth plans to continue reducing debt to meet its target in the near term.

The third priority is to stabilize the legacy LTC portfolio, which Genworth has made significant progress on. In 2021, Genworth achieved a new record for approved LTC rate increases of $403 million, deriving a net present value of approximately $2.3 billion. During the annual LTC assumption review, long-term assumption changes were made, mainly to the benefit utilization trend assumptions based on cost of care growth. Despite these changes, LTC margins remain positive, ranging from $0.5 billion to $1 billion.

Genworth's fourth priority is to advance LTC growth initiatives to ensure its long-term viability. The company is establishing Global Care Solutions, a new business line, and has hired Joost Heideman as its CEO to lead these initiatives. They aim to provide advice, consulting, and services to address the needs of elderly Americans and their families. The acquisition of CareScout in 2008 has proven valuable, and Genworth plans to invest approximately $8 million in the first quarter to expand CareScout's clinical assessment capabilities and support healthcare organizations.

Genworth's fifth and final strategic priority is returning capital to shareholders. Given its improved financial position, Genworth plans to consider a capital management program later in 2022. An update on these plans will be provided in the next earnings call. Overall, Genworth has made substantial strides in turnaround and remains confident in its plans to drive shareholder value.
