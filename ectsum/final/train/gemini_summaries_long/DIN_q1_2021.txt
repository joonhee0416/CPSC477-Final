Dine Brands Global, the parent company of IHOP and Applebee's, reported impressive financial results and operational improvements in the first quarter of 2021. Despite the challenges of the pandemic, both brands exceeded pre-pandemic sales levels during the quarter, a testament to the growing "restaurant renaissance." Off-premise sales also remained strong, with IHOP and Applebee's exceeding 2020 levels when they were 100% off-premise. The company generated $204.2 million in revenue, reflecting strong performance across its business, and free cash flow of $30.7 million, enabling it to repay its $220 million revolver. Franchisees opened 10 new restaurants during the quarter, indicating a shift towards growth. Applebee's, in particular, has experienced significant momentum with same-store sales outperforming the casual dining segment for 12 consecutive weeks, driven by successful marketing campaigns and operational excellence. IHOP also saw improvements, executing against its strategies of focusing on non-peak dayparts, providing value, and maintaining off-premise sales. The company announced plans to test a new small prototype and launch additional Flip'd by IHOP locations in 2021. Dine Brands is cautiously optimistic about the future, acknowledging that there may be challenges ahead but expressing confidence in its long-term sustainable growth strategy.
