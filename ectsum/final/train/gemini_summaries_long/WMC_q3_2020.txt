Western Asset Mortgage Capital Corporation (WMC) experienced a surge in valuations for its residential and commercial credit assets in Q3 2020. Consequently, WMC's GAAP book value increased by 29.2% to $4.07 per share, and GAAP net income was $59.8 million ($0.98 per share), with core earnings of $6.4 million ($0.10 per share). Despite reducing recourse leverage from 3 times to 2.2 times, WMC's net interest margin improved to 2.27%. Amidst the economic recovery, WMC resumed its dividend payments with a $0.05 per share cash dividend. Non-QM residential loan performance improved, with a decline in the forbearance plan percentage from 16% to 10%, indicating prioritization of mortgage payments by borrowers with home equity. The commercial loan and non-agency CMBS portfolios remain largely performing, with over 82% of CMBS loans current despite retail and hotel exposures. WMC believes its focus on high-quality commercial and residential borrowers will mitigate overall impairment from the economic crisis. With favorable refinancing demand and home price appreciation, WMC anticipates continued residential portfolio performance. The company remains optimistic about future core earnings and dividend stability, although recovery prospects depend on COVID-19 trajectory and government support.
