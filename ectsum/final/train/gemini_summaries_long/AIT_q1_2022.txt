Applied Industrial Technologies reported strong Q1 performance with record sales, EBITDA, and EPS. Despite inflationary pressures and supply chain constraints, organic sales grew 16.3%, driven by solid demand in technology, chemicals, lumber, and industrial machinery sectors. The company's strong industry position and operational capabilities, as well as ongoing growth initiatives, supported these results. However, supply chain challenges are persisting, leading to component delays and fulfillment timing. To offset headwinds, Applied Industrial Technologies is leveraging price actions, channel execution, and productivity gains, resulting in EBITDA margin expansion. The company's strong balance sheet, increasing order momentum, and favorable demand outlook support its fiscal 2022 guidance.
