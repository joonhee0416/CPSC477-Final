LTC Properties' Q4 results reflect industry challenges but also resilience. Rent collections remained strong at 98%, but occupancy levels in both assisted living (71%) and skilled nursing (66%) continue to face challenges. Despite these headwinds, LTC has been proactive in providing rent relief to operators and focusing on accretive transactions. The company has a strong balance sheet, providing liquidity for investments in growth opportunities while maintaining conservative underwriting standards. LTC remains optimistic that industry conditions will improve as vaccinations become more widespread and the new administration prioritizes pandemic response. The company's partnership-based approach, coupled with its flexible balance sheet, positions it well to navigate the current environment and pursue accretive growth in the future.
