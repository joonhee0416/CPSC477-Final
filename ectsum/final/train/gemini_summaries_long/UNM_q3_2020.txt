Despite ongoing challenges posed by COVID-19, Unum reported solid financial results in the third quarter, with adjusted operating income of $245.9 million or $1.21 per diluted common share. While high mortality rates impacted life insurance and long-term care businesses, the team made progress on rate increase approvals for closed long-term care. The investment portfolio continued to trend favorably, exceeding expectations for impairments and downgrades. Unum remains focused on its business model, expecting a return to normal conditions and demonstrating the importance of financial protection for employers and employees. The company's capital position remains strong, with RBC at approximately 380% and holding company cash at $1.2 billion. Despite short-term negative trends due to the pandemic, Unum remains optimistic about the future and is investing in growth areas like digital assets and customer experience improvements. The return to normal activities has resulted in higher dental utilization and a return to non-COVID-related STD claims, but the company expects these influences to moderate in future quarters.
