Energy Transfer generated $2.6 billion in adjusted EBITDA, $1.3 billion in DCF, and $900 million in excess cash flow after distributions in the third quarter. NGL volumes on wholly owned and joint venture pipelines reached a record 1.8 million barrels per day, while fractionators reached 884,000 barrels per day. The company expects Enable Midstream Partners' acquisition to provide over $100 million in annual run rate cost synergies and is expected to close before year-end. Growth projects, including the Cushing South Phase 2 pipeline and the Ted Collins link, are on track and expected to increase capacity and export capabilities. The company's Nederland terminal's NGL export capacity exceeds 1.1 million barrels per day, making it one of the largest in the world. Alternative energy projects, such as solar and carbon capture, are progressing and are expected to contribute to Energy Transfer's energy franchise. Despite higher volumes, adjusted EBITDA was down compared to Q3 2020 due to optimization gains and expenses related to Winter Storm Uri. The company expects to generate significant cash flow in 2022 and prioritize debt reduction.
