Envestnet reported strong Q2 financial results, exceeding expectations. Adjusted revenue reached $235 million, driven by favorable asset-based revenue due to increased usage of overlay and direct indexing solutions. Adjusted EBITDA climbed 29% to $55.8 million, resulting in adjusted EPS of $0.59, a 28% increase. The company sees continued growth in the second half of the year, driven by a positive market outlook. Despite the current environment, Envestnet maintains its long-term adjusted EBITDA margin target in the mid- to upper 20s. The company closed nine offices to facilitate remote work, driving down operating expenses. Additionally, it launched Advisor Services Exchange, allowing RIAs access to capital, and Insights Solutions, enabling financial institutions to personalize insights for customers. Envestnet remains committed to innovation and the integration of data and technology to enhance financial wellness, and its recent acquisition of MoneyGuide and the success of its platform further underscore these efforts.
