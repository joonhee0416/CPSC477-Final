Despite the ongoing impact of COVID-19, Brandywine Realty Trust reported improved occupancy and leasing metrics during its second quarter earnings call. Portfolio occupancy rose to 33%, with tenants for spaces under 50,000 square feet accounting for over 45% of that increase. They observed a growing need for space planning and parking due to concerns over public transportation. The company achieved positive absorption for the quarter and reduced its forward rollover exposure to an average of 6% over the next three years, providing improved stability for its portfolio. Revenue and earnings growth remain priorities, with several key vacancies expected to generate additional revenue over the next eight quarters. Brandywine also highlighted its development pipeline, with a 23% increase in the quarter, and the potential for significant earnings growth from mixed-use master plan sites at Schuylkill Yards and Broadmoor. Despite lower-than-anticipated NOI due to factors such as the pandemic, the company maintained strong rent collections (99%) and tenant retention (58%). Mark-to-market results exceeded business plan ranges, and while same-store NOI growth is currently below expectations, the company anticipates it will accelerate in the second half of the year.
