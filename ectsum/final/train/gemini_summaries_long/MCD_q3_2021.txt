McDonald's reported a continuation of its robust global business performance with third-quarter global comp sales rising nearly 13%, or 10% over a two-year period. International Operated Markets (IOM) comps accelerated to nearly 9%, driven by strong growth in the UK, Canada, France, and Germany, as markets continue to recover and benefit from government restrictions easing. Despite challenges in Australia, IOM is expected to maintain a similar two-year trend in Q4. In the US, comp sales rose nearly 10%, or 14.6% over two years, supported by strong menu and marketing efforts and record-high franchisee cash flow. The launch of the loyalty program has exceeded expectations, driving digital adoption with over 1 million members enrolled and 15 million active loyalty members. In International Developmental Licensed markets, comp sales grew nearly 17%, or about 5% over two years, primarily due to positive results in Japan and Latin America, offset by China's challenges. McDonald's remains confident in China's long-term potential and plans to accelerate new restaurant growth, exceeding their initial target for 2022. With its strong overall performance, McDonald's expects systemwide sales to increase in the high teens in constant currencies for the full-year.
