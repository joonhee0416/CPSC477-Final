CF Industries reported a strong 2020 with net earnings of $317 million, despite challenges posed by the pandemic. The company set all-time records for safety, ammonia production, and sales volumes. Looking ahead, CF is optimistic about 2021 due to a robust global nitrogen pricing outlook driven by strong commodity crop prices and higher energy prices. The disruptions caused by weather conditions in the Southern Plains and Midwest are expected to further tighten nitrogen supply for the spring planting season, supporting the positive demand environment. Longer term, CF is excited about its commitment to the clean energy economy and the potential for green and low-carbon ammonia. The company plans to invest in its Green ammonia project at Donaldsonville and evaluate opportunities to reduce gross debt over time. CF anticipates capital expenditures of $450 million in 2021 and expects gross ammonia production of 9.5-10 million tons. Margins are expected to improve this year due to positive nitrogen pricing.
