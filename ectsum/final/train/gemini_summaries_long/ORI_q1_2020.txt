Old Republic reported strong Q1 2020 results driven by its Title Insurance segment, largely unaffected by COVID-19 impacts. Consolidated net premiums and fees earned grew 10%, operating income increased 17.5% to $0.47 per share, and net investment income rose 2%. Despite a substantial fair value decline in its equity portfolio, the company maintained a low debt leverage ratio and adequate liquidity. The Title Insurance segment performed exceptionally well, with a 24% increase in total premium and fee revenue and a 110.6% surge in pre-tax operating income. The General Insurance group saw modest growth in net premiums earned, but a slightly higher expense ratio resulted in an elevated composite ratio. The company continues to pursue options to return excess capital from its mortgage guaranty run-off operation. Overall, Old Republic's financial strength and diversification between its Title Insurance and General Insurance businesses position it well to weather the economic challenges resulting from COVID-19.
