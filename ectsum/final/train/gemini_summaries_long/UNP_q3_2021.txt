Union Pacific's third quarter performance was marked by a 12% increase in freight revenue due to higher fuel surcharges, pricing gains, and positive business mix, despite network disruptions and global supply chain challenges. The company set quarterly records in operating income, net income, and earnings per share, which amounted to $2.57. Despite a flat volume, revenue growth was driven by industrial segments, offsetting declines in premium business. However, automotive and intermodal volumes faced challenges due to semiconductor shortages and supply chain disruptions. Looking ahead, Union Pacific anticipates continued momentum in the grain business, strength in industrial markets, and challenges in premium and intermodal segments. The company is also working to restore network fluidity and improve trip plan compliance to better support customers. Union Pacific remains confident in its long-term goals for growth and is poised to finish 2021 as the company's most profitable year ever.
