CF Industries reported solid financial results for the first nine months of 2020, with adjusted EBITDA exceeding $1 billion. Despite lower global nitrogen prices, the company benefited from reduced natural gas and SG&A costs. While the third quarter typically sees the lowest realized prices and volumes, the overall performance remains consistent with other industry trends. The company expects to end the year with full-year adjusted EBITDA within a few percentage points of its 2018 performance. Looking ahead to 2021, CF anticipates solid global demand, widening energy spreads, and increasing price realizations. The company is well-positioned to capitalize on these opportunities with its low production costs. Notably, CF Industries announced a significant investment in a green ammonia project, leveraging its position as the world's largest ammonia producer to become a leader in the clean energy economy.
