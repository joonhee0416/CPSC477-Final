Despite challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, Comerica achieved strong financial results in 2020 and the fourth quarter. Loan performance remained solid, average deposits reached an all-time high, and the net interest margin increased slightly. Credit quality was strong, with net charge-offs at only 22 basis points. Non-interest income rebounded as customer activity increased, driven by derivative income, commercial lending fees, and card fees. Expenses were well-controlled, and the company maintained strong capital levels with a CET1 ratio of 10.35%. Looking ahead to the first quarter, Comerica anticipates loan growth excluding PPP loans, but expects net interest income pressure due to lower average loan balances, lower yields on securities, and lower LIBOR. Overall, Comerica remains confident in its ability to navigate the economic recovery and continue delivering shareholder value.
