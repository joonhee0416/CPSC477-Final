CenterPoint Energy reported strong first quarter results, including $0.47 of utility earnings per share, aligned with historical trends. The company is reaffirming its full-year utility earnings per share guidance range and long-term earnings growth target. CenterPoint announced the sale of its Arkansas and Oklahoma gas LDCs, valuing the assets at 2.5 times 2020 rate base, which will provide $300 million in incremental after-tax proceeds. This sale demonstrates the undervaluation of remaining gas LDCs and the industry's support for natural gas as an affordable energy source. The company is actively working to reduce incremental gas costs from the winter storm, with $2.2 billion of costs impacted by regulations, legislation, and securitization efforts. CenterPoint is on track to spend $3.4 billion in capital expenditures in 2021, with 2% to 3% growth in organic customers. Despite this, the company may reinvest some O&M savings into utility assets. The company is committed to environmental stewardship and is developing an industry-leading carbon strategy, set to be unveiled in the third quarter of 2021. CenterPoint's transition to a premium utility involves delivering consistent earnings growth, investing in rate base infrastructure, adhering to ESG principles, maintaining financial strength, eliminating midstream exposure, and enhancing customer experiences.
