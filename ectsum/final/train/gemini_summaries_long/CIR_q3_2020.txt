Despite ongoing macro challenges, CIRCOR delivered a strong third quarter due to its transformed portfolio, geographical diversification, and product differentiation. Sales remained flat at $187 million, in line with expectations, with a companywide decremental of 19%, driven by productivity and aggressive cost actions. The industrial segment saw orders decrease organically by 23%, while the Aerospace & Defense segment experienced a 9% decline. The industrial segment margin was impacted by lower sales volume and COVID-19 related production delays, but excluding this impact, the margin would have been higher. The Aerospace & Defense segment expanded its margin by 360 basis points, demonstrating CIRCOR's ability to execute even in a downturn. Despite the pandemic's impact, management expressed optimism about the fourth quarter, projecting sequential improvement in both segments, with defense revenue expected to grow between 20% and 25% compared to Q3. CIRCOR remains focused on long-term shareholder value, with continued investment in new products and cost reduction initiatives.
