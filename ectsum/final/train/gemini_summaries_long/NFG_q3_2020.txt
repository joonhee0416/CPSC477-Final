National Fuel reports a challenging third quarter amidst lower commodity prices, particularly impacting its E&P gathering business. However, its Pipeline and Storage segment performed strongly due to Supply Corporation's recent rate settlement and stable utility earnings. The company recently acquired Shell's Appalachian assets for a combination of debt and equity, significantly increasing its presence in the region and boosting production by 32% in fiscal 2021. As a result, cash flow from operations is expected to exceed $150 million in its E&P and gathering businesses next year. Moreover, ongoing growth in the Pipeline and Storage segment and steady utility operations are expected to significantly increase earnings per share in fiscal 2021, with a range of $3.40 to $3.70. The company remains financially strong, with ample liquidity and a favorable capital structure.
