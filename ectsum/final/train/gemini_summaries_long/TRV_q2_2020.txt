Travelers experienced a strong quarter despite the pandemic, with solid underlying underwriting income of $572 million pre-tax. The company's strong production results, excluding premium refunds, led to a 2% growth in net written premiums, driven by strong renewal rate changes in all three segments. Business Insurance achieved a record-high renewal rate change of 7.4%, while Bond & Specialty Insurance reported a solid 3% increase in net written premiums. Personal Insurance's performance was also noteworthy, with a 6% increase in net written premiums excluding premium refunds. The company's underlying combined ratio improved to a strong 91.4%, reflecting a 3.5-point improvement. While COVID-19 had a modest impact on underwriting results, the company recorded $114 million in direct losses and $63 million in premium adjustments, which were largely offset by favorable loss activity. The pandemic's impact on the economy has led to a decline in auto frequency, but the company noted potential offsetting effects in auto severity due to higher speeds and driver distraction. Travelers expressed confidence in continuing to improve returns and benefit from the strength of their franchise as the economy recovers.
