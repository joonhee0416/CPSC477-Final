In a strong third quarter, Cabot reported adjusted EPS of $1.35, its second-best quarterly earnings ever. Amid high demand across businesses, the company has successfully implemented price increases to maintain margins despite raw material volatility. Cabot's performance was driven by strong growth in Reinforcement Materials, with a 71% volume increase year-over-year globally. Performance Chemicals also saw growth, with Performance Additives and Formulated Solutions reporting increases of 17% and 20%, respectively. Purification Solutions EBIT increased due to volume growth in specialty applications. For Q4, Reinforcement Materials expects strong volumes and anticipates margins to slightly moderate due to higher feedstock differentials. Performance Chemicals projects a net unfavorable impact from planned outages and turnarounds. Despite these factors, the company raised its full-year adjusted EPS guidance to $4.85-$5.05, citing strategic growth investments and a solid earnings base. Cabot's strong liquidity and balance sheet position it well for future growth in areas like battery materials, where it holds a strong market position and plans to expand its global footprint.
