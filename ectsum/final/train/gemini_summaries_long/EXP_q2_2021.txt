Eagle reported its second consecutive quarter of record revenue and net earnings growth, driven by strong demand for Cement and Wallboard. Cement shipments reached an all-time high of 2.2 million tons, while Wallboard shipments grew 6%, outperforming industry trends thanks to the company's strategic focus on the South. Infrastructure funding remains robust, with local budgets supported by rising property values, sales taxes, and gasoline taxes. However, Eagle anticipates potential slower trend growth in the near term due to economic uncertainties. The planned separation of Cement and Wallboard businesses is still intact, but timing remains uncertain amidst market volatility. Despite the pandemic, Eagle's financial position remains strong with $700 million in total liquidity, a net debt-to-cap ratio of 48%, and a net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio of 2 times. The company continues to prioritize debt reduction and preserve financial flexibility.
