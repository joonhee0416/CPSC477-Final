Worthington Industries reported mixed financial results in Q3. Sales surged by 82% to $1.4 billion, driven by higher steel prices, acquisitions, and increased average selling prices in consumer and building products. However, earnings per share dropped to $1.11 from $1.27 in the prior year due to inventory holding losses of $25 million, compared to gains in the prior year. Steel processing faced challenges with lower ship tons and adjusted EBIT declining from $62 million to $7 million. Despite the setback, consumer products performed well with an EBIT margin of 16.5%, driven by price increases and strong demand. Building products also experienced growth, with adjusted EBIT margin reaching 37.3%. Unfortunately, Sustainable Energy Solutions reported an adjusted EBIT loss of $3 million due to higher costs. The company remains cautious about market volatility and the impact of the Ukraine conflict on steel supply and demand. Despite these challenges, Worthington Industries expects strong demand in its building products and consumer segments while recognizing the potential opportunities in emissions reductions and hydrogen ecosystem solutions.
