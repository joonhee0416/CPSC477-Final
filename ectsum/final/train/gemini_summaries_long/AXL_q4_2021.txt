In Q4 2021, AAM reported an adjusted loss per share of $0.09 despite challenges posed by semiconductor shortages and global supply chain disruptions. However, AAM generated solid sales of $1.24 billion during the quarter, reflecting volume recovery from the pandemic. For the full year 2021, AAM's adjusted earnings per share reached $0.93, a significant improvement from $0.14 in 2020.
