Meritage Homes reported a record-breaking fourth quarter and 2020, despite the challenges of the pandemic. The housing market remained robust, with strong demand for entry-level and first move-up homes, which Meritage Homes focuses on. The company's sales orders surged by 52% in Q4 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, and home closing revenue increased by 28%. Meritage Homes achieved its best quarterly home closing gross margin in 14 years, reaching 24% and reflecting price increases and operational efficiencies. Despite the shift towards affordable homes, the company experienced solid demand for its first move-up communities. In 2020, Meritage Homes set new records in sales orders, closings, and home closing revenue, with an all-time high average absorption pace since 2005. The company's strong financial performance was accompanied by a disciplined approach to land acquisition and development, as well as improvements in its balance sheet. Meritage Homes has acquired all the land necessary to achieve its goal of operating 300 communities by mid-2022. For 2021, the company projects home closing revenue of $4.2 - 4.6 billion and diluted earnings per share in the range of $10.50 - 11.50.
