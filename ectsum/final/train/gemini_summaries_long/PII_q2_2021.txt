Polaris reported strong Q2 results, exceeding expectations with adjusted earnings per share of $2.70, up 108% year-over-year. Adjusted sales grew 40% to $2,117 million, driven by strong demand across all segments. Market share gains continued in ATVs and side-by-sides, with boats also performing well. International sales grew 64%, benefiting from improving economic conditions. Despite supply chain challenges, the company remains confident in customer demand and has raised its full-year earnings guidance to a range of $9.35 to $9.60 per share. However, the second half of the year is expected to see a decline in earnings compared to H2 2020 due to increasing input costs, primarily commodity, labor, and supply chain-related expenses. Polaris continues to navigate supply chain disruptions, with dealer inventories remaining low and expected to normalize late in 2022 or even 2023. The company is focused on mitigating the impact of these challenges and delivering improved results for shareholders.
