Despite strong first-quarter results, Robert Half faces challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Companywide revenues reached $1.507 billion, a 3% increase year-over-year. Staffing revenues declined slightly, while Protiviti, a subsidiary specializing in consulting, saw double-digit revenue growth. The pandemic's impact became evident in March, leading to a 6% revenue decline in temporary and consulting staffing. April revenues were down 25% for temporary and consulting staffing and 63% for permanent placement compared to last year, prompting cost-cutting measures including furloughs and layoffs. However, Robert Half remains optimistic about recovery, citing historical patterns where demand for their services increases as businesses ramp up during economic rebounds. The company's strong balance sheet and liquidity provide financial resilience.
