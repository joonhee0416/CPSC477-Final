Redwood Trust posted strong first-quarter results, driven by strong operating income and portfolio valuations. GAAP earnings reached $0.72 per diluted share, up from $0.42 in Q4 2020. GAAP book value per share increased by almost 9% to $10.76, exceeding the dividend of $0.16 per share. The company continues to invest in technology, including the launch of Redwood Horizons, which focuses on innovation in financial and real estate technology. Despite a recent increase in interest rates, Redwood is well-positioned to manage market changes with its diverse business model and commitment to technology. The residential business experienced record lock volumes and increased margins, while the BPL mortgage banking segment saw growth in single-family rental loans and bridge loans. The investment portfolio performed well, with total portfolio returns rising due to improved credit and faster prepayment speeds. Redwood has a strong balance sheet with unrestricted cash of $426 million and plans to explore adding modest leverage to its investment portfolio. The company remains focused on growth, technological efficiency, and profitability, with expectations of continued growth in book value and net interest income supported by a stable dividend.
