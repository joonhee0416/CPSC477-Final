UMH, a leading manufactured housing community operator, reported strong financial performance despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Third-quarter normalized FFO per diluted share increased by 20% to $0.18, now fully covered by operating performance. Rental collections remain strong, with over 98% collected for the quarter. The company achieved a 320 basis point improvement in same-community occupancy and a 54% increase in sales growth compared to last year. UMH's success is driven by its rental home program, which has proven to be a stable income stream during the pandemic. The company plans to continue acquiring communities, developing sites, and improving cost of capital to enhance its FFO. With a strong foundation and a shortage of affordable housing, UMH is well-positioned for continued growth in 2021 and beyond.
