Harsco delivered strong Q2 results with record revenue and EBITDA growth, surpassing analyst expectations. The Environmental segment benefited from increased steel production and an improved mix of services, while Clean Earth continued to perform well, realizing integration synergies and capturing higher hazardous waste volumes. The Rail segment recorded its highest quarterly profit in two years, driven by a recovery in domestic spending and its global aftermarket platform. Despite macroeconomic headwinds such as labor shortages and inflation, Harsco is optimistic about the second half of the year due to positive market momentum and internal improvements. The company maintained its 2021 outlook, projecting adjusted EBITDA between $295-$310 million and free cash flow of $35-$55 million. Q3 guidance anticipates further improvement in each segment, especially Clean Earth and Rail, with adjusted EBITDA expected to range from $75-$81 million.
