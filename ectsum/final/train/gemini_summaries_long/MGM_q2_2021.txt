MGM Resorts experienced a high level of customer demand in the second quarter, leading to all-time record margins in their Las Vegas and regional segments. Las Vegas weekend volumes have returned to normal, largely due to leisure and domestic casino customers. The company has invested heavily in its digital capabilities and customer growth strategies, resulting in BetMGM's position as the No. 2 operator in the U.S. sports betting and iGaming market. MGM has also increased diversification into Asia through footprint expansion in Macau and an integrated resort opportunity in Japan. Despite rising COVID-19 cases, the company remains confident in its long-term positioning in Las Vegas, as demonstrated by the recent surge in July's operating performance. MGM has simplified its corporate structure and monetized its real estate premium valuations to become asset light. The company has announced multiple transactions involving the sale and leaseback of properties, resulting in $11.6 billion in domestic liquidity. MGM remains committed to returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and will continue to invest in strategic growth opportunities. The company's strong balance sheet, operational excellence, and unwavering conviction in Macau's recovery position it well for the future.
