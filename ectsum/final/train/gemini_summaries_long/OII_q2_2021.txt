Oceaneering reported strong Q2 2021 results with adjusted EBITDA exceeding consensus estimates and a revenue increase of over 19% in four out of five operating segments. The company raised its 2021 EBITDA guidance range to $200-$225 million, driven by increased demand, positive commodity prices, and improving economic recovery. Despite a projected decline in Q3 revenue and operating results, Oceaneering remains optimistic about its long-term prospects. The Subsea Robotics segment posted a 14% sequential revenue growth and improved adjusted operating income with higher ROV days on hire, while the Offshore Projects Group anticipates lower revenue but flat adjusted operating results in Q3. Integrity Management and Digital Solutions expects stable revenue and adjusted operating results, and Aerospace and Defense Technologies forecasts lower revenue and operating results due to project mix. Oceaneering has generated $37.9 million in free cash flow during Q2, reduced net debt, and maintains a strong cash position with $456 million on hand. The company continues to expect excess free cash flow generation in 2021 and remains focused on growth, financial flexibility, and debt management.
