Glatfelter faced challenges in Q2 due to destocking in the Airlaid segment and higher energy prices in Composite Fibers, resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $0.18, below expectations. However, strong demand recovery in tabletop products and Mount Holly's positive contributions offset these headwinds. Airlaid Materials is expected to experience robust growth in Q3, with shipments projected to be 15-20% higher. Composite Fibers anticipates a 2-3% shipment increase and fully offsetting price increases in Q3. Corporate costs remain well-managed, with full-year guidance revised downward. The company is optimistic about the second half of 2021 and beyond, citing strong demand, pricing actions taking hold, and the pending acquisition of Jacob Holm, which is expected to enhance scale, diversification, and synergies.
