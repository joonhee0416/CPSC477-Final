Horace Mann reported a strong second quarter marked by a 52% increase in core earnings per share to $1.02, the highest ever for a second quarter. This was driven by strong investment income, particularly in the alternatives portfolio, and lower than expected catastrophe losses. The acquisition of Madison National Life Insurance Company, a leading provider of employee benefits to educators, is expected to add 50 basis points of ROE in the first 12 months after closing. Horace Mann's commitment to serving the education market through multiline products and a focus on sustainability has led to a solid sales momentum in the retirement line, with double-digit growth in annuity contract deposits. The company expects to reach its targeted 15% allocation to alternative investments within the next two years, driving higher net investment income and supporting a double-digit ROE. With the acquisition of Madison National, Horace Mann will expand its addressable market and complement its existing distribution capabilities. The company remains confident in its outlook, with updated guidance reflecting higher net investment income assumptions.
