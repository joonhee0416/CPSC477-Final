MGIC's Q3 2021 earnings call highlighted strong financial results, with a GAAP net income of $158 million. The company's success was attributed to increasing insurance in force, a strong housing market, and low delinquency rates. Despite a slowdown in refinance activity, purchase applications remained robust, accounting for 85% of pipeline applications. Insurance in force grew by 2.4% to $268 billion, driven by higher annual persistency rates. The loss ratio remained low at 8.1%, reflecting positive credit trends and a decline in new delinquency notices. MGIC's capital position remained strong, with excess PMIERs available assets totaling $2.6 billion and a sufficiency ratio of 180%. The company executed on its capital management strategy by repurchasing 10 million shares and paying increased common stock dividends, and it is considering the retirement of debentures due in 2063, which would further strengthen its capital position. Overall, MGIC is optimistic about the future, with the housing market remaining strong and the company's positioning well-aligned with current market conditions.
