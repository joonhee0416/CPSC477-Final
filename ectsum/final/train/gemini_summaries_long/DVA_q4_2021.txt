In Q4 of 2021, DaVita's adjusted operating income exceeded guidance, resulting in a 3% increase from 2020 and a 26% growth in earnings per share. Despite COVID-related headwinds, the company saw an increase in kidney transplant rates, exceeding pre-pandemic levels. However, the labor market remains challenging, leading to higher wage increases and a projected $100-$125 million increase in labor costs. Supply chain issues, primarily related to dialysis, are expected to persist into Q2, but the company has maintained uninterrupted care delivery. Integrated Kidney Care operations saw an increase in operating loss due to upfront costs and lag of shared savings payments, resulting in an expected $50 million increase in the U.S. ancillary segment's loss for 2022. Despite near-term challenges, DaVita expects long-term growth and maintains its projected compound annual growth of 3%-7% for adjusted operating income and 8%-14% for earnings per share.
