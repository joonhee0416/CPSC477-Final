Glatfelter reported mixed Q4 results with EPS of $0.04 missing estimates due to external factors including energy inflation in Europe, supply chain disruptions, and labor shortages. Airlaid Materials performance was in line with expectations, driven by cost pass-through arrangements and strong recovery in tabletop products. Conversely, Composite Fibers results were significantly lower due to unprecedented energy costs and inflation, exacerbated by an energy surcharge implemented in November. Spunlace, acquired in October, also underperformed due to raw material and energy cost pressures, lower shipments, and operational challenges. Despite these headwinds, Glatfelter remains confident in its acquisitions, with Mount Holly performing as expected and Spunlace positioning the company for long-term growth in non-wovens. The company is taking measures to address inflationary pressures, including energy cost pass-through mechanisms in Composite Fibers, cost reductions, and optimizing operations. Glatfelter expects first-quarter results to be impacted by continued input cost pressures and lower volumes, particularly in Composite Fibers. The Spunlace segment is projected to experience a loss in Q1, and the company is actively addressing this issue. Despite the challenging environment, Glatfelter believes in the strategic benefits of its acquisitions and aims to accelerate profitability and mitigate inflationary challenges throughout 2022.
