Edwards reported solid fourth quarter 2021 results, driven by strong growth in its TAVR therapy portfolio. Despite the impact of the Omicron variant in December, TAVR sales rose 13% on an underlying basis, largely driven by international markets. Edwards remains confident in its long-term TAVR opportunity, with a target to double sales to $10 billion by 2028. The company also made significant progress in its TMTT business, completing enrollment in pivotal trials for early-stage and moderate aortic stenosis. TMTT sales more than doubled in 2021, and Edwards anticipates continued growth in this market. Additionally, Edwards reported steady growth in its Surgical Structural Heart and Critical Care businesses, with solid sales increases in both segments. Despite a slow start to 2022 due to Omicron, Edwards maintained its previous sales guidance for the full year, expecting total sales to grow by a low double-digit rate.
