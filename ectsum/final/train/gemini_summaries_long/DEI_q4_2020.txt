Despite ongoing pandemic headwinds, Douglas Emmett reported improved rent collection and leasing activity during the fourth quarter. The company's quarterly FFO was $0.46 per share, a 15% decrease from Q4 2019. Same-property cash NOI declined by 20%, while G&A expenses remained low at 4.6% of revenues. To date, Douglas Emmett has reached payment plans with tenants covering 15% of outstanding rent balances, and has collected 92.7% of rent from the pandemic-affected quarters. Leasing demand increased, driven by smaller tenants, resulting in 197 signed leases and above-average retention. The company signed 197 office leases covering 612,000 square feet, with the average lease size decreasing to 3,100 feet. The leases signed in Q4 are expected to provide almost 10% more rent than the expiring leases. Multifamily occupancy improved, with the lease rate increasing to 98.2%. Occupancy is expected to decline in the first half of 2021 due to the lagging indicator effect. The company remains optimistic about the long-term recovery of the office market, with confidence in tenants returning to work and a lack of new supply. Douglas Emmett's financial strength remains solid, with no debt maturities before 2023.
