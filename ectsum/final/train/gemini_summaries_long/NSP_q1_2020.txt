Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, Insperity experienced a strong first quarter, exceeding budget expectations by 25% due to increased Business Performance Advisors and improved sales efficiency. The company's benefit plan also performed well, as elevated large claims declined and benefit allocations outpaced expectations.

In response to the health and economic crisis, Insperity formed a business continuity support team to assist clients and played a key role in facilitating Paycheck Protection Program loans. Client layoffs totaled approximately 9% of the worksite employee base by the end of April, with 65% classified as temporary furloughs. However, rehires already account for 10% of the total, potentially aided by the Paycheck Protection Program.

Insperity anticipates a range of future results based on economic conditions. The high case assumes a gradual recovery with 65% of furloughed employees rehired by clients for loan forgiveness purposes. Sales in this scenario are estimated at 80% of budget, with lower terminations and a gross profit increase. The low case considers a slower recovery with fewer rehires and sales at around 60% of budget, as well as higher terminations.

Despite the uncertainty, Insperity remains optimistic about supporting small and medium-sized businesses in their recovery. The company plans to continue investing in Business Performance Advisors while maintaining corporate staff levels to meet increased service demands. Insperity's guidance for the full year 2020 reflects a range of possibilities, with adjusted EBITDA forecast at $215 million to $250 million and adjusted EPS at $3.19 to $3.86. The second quarter is expected to show a positive impact due to lower healthcare utilization, while the second half of the year may experience higher costs associated with deferred elective care and COBRA participation.
