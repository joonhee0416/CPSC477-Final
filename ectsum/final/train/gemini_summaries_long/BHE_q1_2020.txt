Despite the challenges of COVID-19, Benchmark achieved Q1 2020 revenue of $515 million, primarily driven by strong demand in Medical, Semi-Cap, and A&D sectors. While revenue was below previous guidance due to increased costs and under absorption, the company maintained a healthy balance sheet with positive net cash of approximately $170 million. Benchmark's supply chain team has proactively managed parts supply during this pandemic, but operations and supply chain constraints are expected to impact revenue translation in Q2. Medical and Semi-Cap continue to experience strong demand, while Industrial, traditional markets, and A&D (excluding defense) are facing challenges. Benchmark remains focused on cost reduction measures, including salary cuts and furloughs, while prioritizing the maintenance of critical resources for long-term growth. Key strategic initiatives remain unchanged, and the company's competitive position is strong, providing confidence in its ability to navigate the current environment and capture future opportunities.
