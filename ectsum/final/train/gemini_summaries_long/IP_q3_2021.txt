In Q3, International Paper experienced strong growth in revenue, earnings, and margins driven by solid demand for corrugated packaging and absorbent pulp. Despite these gains, supply chain constraints limited the company's ability to fully capture market opportunities, resulting in input cost increases of $230 million ($0.46 per share). The Industrial Packaging segment saw strong demand but was impacted by low containerboard inventories, while the Global Cellulose Fibers segment faced port congestion and vessel delays. However, the Ilim joint venture maintained its strong performance, contributing equity earnings of $95 million. The company made significant progress in strengthening its balance sheet, reducing debt by $235 million and fully funding its pension plan. Capital allocation included $411 million returned to shareholders and an additional $2 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board. Moving forward, International Paper expects to implement value drivers that will generate $200-$225 million of incremental earnings in 2022 and ramp up to $350-$400 million in 2024, focusing on cost reduction and commercial optimization.
