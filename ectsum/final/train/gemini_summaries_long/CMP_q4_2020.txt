In 2020, Compass Minerals faced adverse weather conditions, affecting its Salt segment's revenue and operating income. However, enterprisewide optimization efforts helped mitigate these impacts, reducing unit costs by $1.25 per ton. The Plant Nutrition segment experienced challenges in North America due to wildfires and drought, resulting in higher costs and lower margins. Despite these headwinds, the company generated $175 million in operating cash flow and $90 million in free cash flow. For 2021, Compass Minerals anticipates normalized Salt volumes, high single-digit sales growth in Plant Nutrition South America, and a slight decline in Plant Nutrition North America volumes. The company expects to see a 20% year-over-year increase in adjusted EBITDA to between $330 million and $360 million, primarily driven by optimization benefits. Compass Minerals remains focused on improving its balance sheet and maintaining a strong liquidity position, with its net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio projected to end 2021 below 4 times.
