Darden reported a decline in total sales and same-restaurant sales for Q3 due to the pandemic's impact. Despite this, the company highlighted its robust business model, driven by significant scale, extensive data, strategic planning, and a results-oriented culture. These advantages enabled Darden to execute its Back to Basics strategy, streamline menus, simplify operations, and deploy technology to improve the guest experience. As a result, hourly labor productivity improved by over 20%, and restaurant-level EBITDA margins increased. Darden's investment in team members included bonuses and hourly wage increases, strengthening its industry-leading employment proposition. Despite the challenges, Darden's financial performance was bolstered by cost reductions and operational simplifications, with restaurant-level EBITDA margin only 150 basis points below last year's figure. The company declared a pre-COVID quarterly dividend and authorized a $500 million share repurchase program. Looking ahead, Darden estimates Q4 sales of $2.1 billion and earnings per share between $1.60 and $1.70. For fiscal 2022, the company anticipates capital spending between $350 million and $400 million, opening 35 new restaurants, and an effective tax rate ranging from 12% to 13%.
