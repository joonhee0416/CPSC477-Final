Despite market challenges in Q4 2021, Annaly maintained earnings availability for distribution of $0.28 per share, exceeding its dividend by $0.06. The company's portfolio is defensively positioned with low leverage, ample liquidity, and a conservative hedge ratio, ensuring resilience in volatile market conditions. Annaly's credit businesses remain a key focus, with the residential credit platform actively acquiring expanded residential whole loans and middle market lending seeing increased capital allocation. The MSR platform has grown significantly, and its value is expected to increase further this year. While agency MBS has underperformed due to Fed policy shifts, the company's conservative hedging has mitigated interest rate risk. As the market adjusts to Fed tightening, Annaly anticipates attractive reinvestment opportunities in agency MBS and increased prospective returns, leading to potential leverage increases in line with its historical framework.
