Despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, Unum reported solid financial results in the second quarter. Adjusted operating income declined marginally to $250.1 million, primarily due to adverse mortality impacts on the group life business and higher expenses in the leave management operation. However, this was partially offset by favorable benefits experience in the group disability line and growth in the supplemental and voluntary lines. Premium income increased by 1.7%, while persistency levels remained stable. The company experienced a wide range of claims trends, including a significant increase in group life claims due to higher COVID-19-related mortality. Nevertheless, the group disability line showed strong performance with an improved benefit ratio, while the dental block benefited from a sharp decline in utilization. Unum International faced challenges in claim assessments and terminations due to COVID-19 disruptions. The Closed Block segment reported positive results, with the long-term care line benefiting from elevated claim mortality and low utilization. However, the Closed Disability Block experienced an increase in submitted incidents. The investment portfolio also saw a dramatic recovery, with a significant improvement in the net unrealized gain position. Despite the pandemic, Unum's capital metrics remained solid, with RBC at approximately 370% and holding company cash at $1.6 billion.
