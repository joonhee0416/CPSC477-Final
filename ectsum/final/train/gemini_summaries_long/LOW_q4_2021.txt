Lowe's reported strong financial performance for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2021. Comparable sales increased 5% for the total company (5.1% in the U.S.) on top of over 28% growth last year, with broad-based growth across product categories and both DIY and Pro customers. Earnings per share increased 34% on an adjusted basis to $1.78, driven by sales growth, improved gross margins, and productivity initiatives. For fiscal 2022, Lowe's raised its sales outlook to a range of $97 billion to $99 billion, representing a comparable sales range of down 1% to up 1%. Gross margin rate is expected to improve slightly, with operating margins estimated to range between 12.8% and 13%. The company continues to invest in its Total Home strategy, with Pro growth of 23% in Q4 and broad-based DIY growth. Lowe's is also expanding its online capabilities, with Lowes.com sales increasing 11.5% in the quarter and representing nearly 11% of sales. The company is also implementing perpetual productivity improvement initiatives that are expected to drive significant cost savings. Despite higher interest rates, Lowe's remains optimistic about the home improvement market due to strong consumer demand, increased home equity, and low housing affordability.
