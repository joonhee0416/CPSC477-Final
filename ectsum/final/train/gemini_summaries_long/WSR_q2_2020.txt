Despite facing pandemic-related challenges, Whitestone's performance in the second quarter remained relatively strong, reflecting the company's resilient business model. Tenant occupancy remained high at 89.2%, with 94% of businesses now reopened. Rent collections have improved, reaching 86% in July compared to 81% in the second quarter and 64% in April. However, the pandemic did impact financial results, with funds from operations dropping to $9.6 million from $11.1 million in the prior year's quarter, primarily due to a $2.8 million charge related to revenue collectibility. The company has implemented cost-cutting measures and increased its cash position by $8 million since March. Whitestone remains optimistic about the future, citing pent-up demand in its markets and its ability to capture opportunities through its experienced management team and focus on community-centered shopping centers in high-growth states.
