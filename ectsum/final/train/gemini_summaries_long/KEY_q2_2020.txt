Key achieved a strong second quarter, experiencing revenue growth of 17% quarter-over-quarter and a record pre-provision net revenue. Consumer mortgage, with originations up 100% year-over-year and fee income tripling, drove the growth in loans and deposits. The company remained disciplined in its risk management practices, with a net charge-off rate of 36 basis points and an increased loan loss reserve of 1.61% excluding PPP loans. Despite COVID-19-related expenses, noninterest expenses were stable quarter-over-quarter. Key maintained a healthy capital position with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.1%. Management expects a low single-digit increase in net interest income for the third quarter, a high single-digit decline in noninterest income due to lower consumer mortgage fees, and a 50 to 60-basis-point range for net charge-offs.
