Conagra Brands delivered strong performance in Q2 despite inflation and supply chain challenges. Net sales increased on the back of elevated consumer demand, favorable elasticities, and pricing actions. While inflation exceeded expectations, margin pressure was higher than anticipated due to additional supply chain costs and investments made to service orders. The company has taken further pricing actions to offset inflation and expects improvement in margins in the second half. Conagra remains focused on long-term growth, emphasizing its strong position in the value segment and targeting younger consumers who are increasingly shifting towards at-home dining. The company's modernization efforts and brand strength have resonated with younger consumers, leading to increased attraction and repeat purchases. Conagra reaffirms its adjusted earnings per share guidance of approximately $2.50 for the full year by increasing organic net sales guidance to approximately 3% and adjusting margin guidance to approximately 15.5%.
