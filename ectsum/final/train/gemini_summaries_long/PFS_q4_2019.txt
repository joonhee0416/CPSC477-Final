Providence Financial reported a core earnings per share of $0.43 for Q4, impacted by slight margin compression and increased expenses related to CECL implementation. The company expects margin compression to remain neutral in 2020. Non-interest bearing deposits saw a 23% increase, leading to a 3 basis point decrease in the total cost of deposits to 65 basis points. Loan originations reached their best levels of the year, but payoffs remained elevated. Credit metrics remained stable, with non-performing assets totaling 55 basis points of total assets. Non-interest income slightly decreased, while non-interest expenses increased due to costs associated with CECL implementation. The company has ample capital for acquisitions and anticipates low single-digit loan portfolio growth and interest-only periods and longer fixed rate terms in residential lending.
