Despite global supply chain challenges, the company delivered strong second-quarter results with 17% sales growth and an adjusted earnings per share of $1.57, a 22% year-over-year increase. The Transportation segment recorded double-digit growth across all businesses, while the Communications segment experienced a notable 29% organic growth due to strong demand in both data & devices and appliances. However, the Industrial segment faced a 4% organic sales decline primarily attributed to the ongoing weakness in commercial aerospace. Despite this, orders remained strong across the board, reflecting ongoing market recovery and supply chain replenishment, particularly in Transportation and Communications. The company anticipates similar levels of sales and adjusted earnings per share in the third quarter, despite supply chain pressures. Execution remains strong, and the company remains optimistic about its long-term growth prospects, citing its leadership positions in key markets and ongoing margin expansion opportunities.
