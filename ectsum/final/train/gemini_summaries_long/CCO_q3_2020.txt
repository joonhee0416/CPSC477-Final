Clear Channel Outdoor reported improved revenue in the third quarter, beating expectations. Consolidated revenue declined by 32%, or 27% excluding China and FX adjustments, driven by a stronger-than-anticipated rebound in Europe. The Americas segment faced a 32% decline, while Europe showed a 13% decline, or 18% excluding FX adjustments. Europe's performance was aided by its focus on roadside locations and improved digital advertising. The company continues to invest in technology and digital footprints, including the addition of digital billboards and partnerships with platforms like Tremor Video. It also secured a significant contract for airport advertising in New York and New Jersey. Despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, the company's resilience is evident as audiences return and advertisers resume campaigns. Clear Channel Outdoor remains cautiously optimistic for the near term, anticipating a slight sequential improvement in Americas revenue and adjusted EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter, but refrains from providing guidance for Europe due to recent mobility restrictions. The company is confident in its ability to return to growth in 2021 and capitalize on the industry's fundamentals.
