IBM's revenue surpassed Kyndryl and currency estimates, reaching $16.7 billion for the fourth quarter, reflecting an 8.6% year-over-year growth at constant currency. Excluding incremental revenue from Kyndryl, IBM's revenue was up 5%. Notably, Software and Consulting saw double-digit revenue growth as Red Hat revenue emerged as a key driver, while Infrastructure was buoyed by strong IBM Z and storage performance. IBM Consulting's hybrid cloud revenue grew significantly and is projected to reach $8 billion for the year, while software annual recurring revenue exceeded $13 billion. IBM's platform-centric approach emphasizes open, secure, and flexible platforms that offer a solid base for software, services, and infrastructure growth. To accelerate this strategy, IBM expanded its ecosystem partnerships with AWS, Azure, and Salesforce, demonstrating strong demand for its hybrid cloud and AI capabilities. The company continues to prioritize investments in innovation, with the acquisition of Envizi to address growing demand for environmental sustainability solutions. IBM projects mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2022 before Kyndryl and currency effects, along with $10 billion to $10.5 billion in free cash flow, in line with its medium-term model.
