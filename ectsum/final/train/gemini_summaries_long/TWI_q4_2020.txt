Despite a challenging 2020 impacted by the pandemic, Titan's fourth quarter and 2021 first quarter results indicate a significant turnaround, particularly in the agricultural sector. Positive market trends, record-low dealer inventories, and improved commodity prices are driving strong demand. The company has focused on strengthening its financial position and has improved its cash position, reduced net debt, and extended its domestic ABL facility to February 2023. Titan's fourth-quarter adjusted gross margin of 11.8% was the highest in the past ten quarters, with the agricultural segment's adjusted gross margin reaching 13%. However, the company faces challenges in meeting the surge in demand due to labor constraints, raw material issues, and logistical challenges. To address these challenges, Titan is aggressively hiring and investing in additional capacity while implementing a rigorous hiring process to mitigate training liabilities. The company is also in discussions with major OEMs on long-term supply agreements. Despite the challenges, Titan is targeting strong growth in sales, EBITDA, and margin expansion in 2021 and intends to remain diligently focused on protecting its balance sheet and managing inventory funding.
