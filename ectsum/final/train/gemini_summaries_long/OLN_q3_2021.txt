Olin's team continues to deliver solid performance, led by a higher value model and strategic allocation of capital. The company expects to exceed 2021 results in 2022 due to strong demand growth across its businesses, particularly in shooting sports, clean energy, and construction. The Epoxy Engineered Materials segment stands out for its differentiated growth profile, with nearly non-substitutable Epoxy performance driving expansion in various end uses. Epichlorohydrin, the key value driver for Epoxy, holds a leading global position and is expected to contribute significantly to the segment's future growth. Olin's focus on debt reduction, refinancing, share repurchases, and M&A aims to generate shareholder value and drive earnings per share above $10 in the near future. The company maintains confidence in managing uncertainty and volatility through its three substantial businesses: Winchester Consumer and Defense (growth), Epoxy Engineered Materials (differentiated growth), and Chlor Alkali products and Vinyls (organic and inorganic growth opportunities).
