REX, with a single segment of ethanol and by-products, reported a strong third quarter. Sales increased by 63% due to higher pricing across ethanol, distiller grains, and corn oil. Despite higher corn and natural gas costs, improved selling prices resulted in a 47% surge in net income from continuing operations to $13.3 million. The company saw increased production volumes due to corn supply improvements. REX's cash balance significantly increased to $219 million, and it repurchased 67,000 shares. Ongoing challenges include logistic issues and lower ethanol production in the prior quarter, which are expected to continue in the first quarter of 2022. Notably, REX is progressing with its carbon sequestration project, having received drilling permits and begun test well preparations. The project, while still in its preliminary stages, holds potential for future cash flow benefits and environmental impact.
