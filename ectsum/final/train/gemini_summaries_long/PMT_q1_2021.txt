PMT delivered a strong Q1 with $65.4 million in net income ($0.67 diluted EPS) due to robust correspondent production results and continued fair value appreciation in its GSE credit risk transfer (CRT) investments. The fair value of MSR investments climbed to $2.4 billion, driven by new investments and gains from higher rates. PMT's CRT investments benefited from elevated prepayment speeds, resulting in $98.1 million in market-driven value gains. The company's interest rate-sensitive strategies faced headwinds, with MSR fair value gains offset by declines in Agency MBS and hedge costs. PMT's correspondent production segment contributed $35.6 million in pre-tax income, but margins have normalized. Despite lower origination volumes expected in the future, PMT anticipates continued investment opportunities as it focuses on conventional correspondent production and the acquisition of high-quality mortgage servicing rights. The company's quarterly run-rate return potential is estimated at $0.50 per share, representing a 9.5% annualized return on equity. PMT's strong balance sheet, enhanced by the issuance of senior exchangeable notes and term asset-backed financing, provides stability and flexibility in the evolving mortgage landscape.
