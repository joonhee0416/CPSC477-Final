Valero's Q4 performance was strong, with record earnings for the quarter and overall year. Refining margins improved due to high product demand, low inventories, and wider sour crude oil discounts. The ethanol segment also saw record operating income, driven by high ethanol prices and low inventories. Valero's renewable diesel business continues to grow, with the DGD expansion project exceeding initial capacity expectations. The company remains optimistic about refining margins and its low-carbon businesses. Valero maintains a strong financial position with a 33% debt-to-capitalization ratio and over $5 billion in liquidity. The company has allocated approximately 50% of its 2022 growth capital to expanding its low-carbon businesses. Q1 2022 guidance includes refining throughput volumes ranging from 1.66 million to 1.71 million barrels per day in the Gulf Coast and estimated renewable diesel sales volumes of approximately 700 million gallons for the year.
