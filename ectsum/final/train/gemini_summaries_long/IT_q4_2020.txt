Gartner's financial performance in Q4 was favorable, despite challenges from the pandemic. Research revenue increased 4% on an FX-neutral basis, driven by elevated interest in topics like data analytics, cost optimization, and talent management. Global Technology Sales (GTS) contract value grew 4%, with improved retention and increasing spends from existing clients. Global Business Sales (GBS) continued its strong performance, achieving a contract value growth of 7%. Virtual conferences, an innovative pivot during the pandemic, exceeded expectations with 13 conferences held in Q4. Consulting revenue declined, but the backlog remained strong. Total contract value reached a record high of $3.6 billion, setting the stage for sustained growth in 2021 and beyond. The company expects to return to revenue growth, double-digit CV and revenue growth, margin expansion, and robust free cash flow generation in the medium term. Additionally, Gartner plans to deploy excess cash towards share repurchases and strategic acquisitions.
