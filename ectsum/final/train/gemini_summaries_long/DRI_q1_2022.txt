Darden Restaurants reported a robust quarter with first-quarter sales up 51% YoY to $2.3 billion, driven by increased same-restaurant sales and new restaurant openings. Despite inflationary pressures, the company's EBITDA margin expanded by 250 basis points to 16% year-over-year, supported by investments in food quality, operational simplifications, and sales leverage. Darden's strong performance was led by LongHorn Steakhouse, which saw a 26% sales increase, and Fine Dining, which grew sales by 24%. The company expects continued sales growth in the fiscal year, with total sales projected at $9.4-$9.6 billion, a 7-9% increase over pre-COVID levels. Darden also raised its earnings per share guidance to $7.25-$7.60, highlighting its ability to navigate inflation and maintain profit margins.
