Highwoods Properties reported Q3 earnings of $0.86 per share, driven by strong rent growth (5.2%) and cost containment. Despite the pandemic, leasing volume improved sequentially, with 660,000 square feet of second-gen leases signed (12.5% GAAP rent growth) and 190,000 square feet of new leases (5% cash rent growth). Occupancy dipped to 90.2%, but is expected to remain stable in Q4. Rent collections remained strong at 99.7% in both Q3 and October, with temporary rent deferrals equating to only 1.2% of annual revenues. Highwoods' portfolio is well-positioned in key markets, including Raleigh (ranked #1 for overall real estate prospects), with a focus on amenitized urban and suburban locations. Despite the ongoing impact of the pandemic, the company remains optimistic about the long-term outlook for growth.
