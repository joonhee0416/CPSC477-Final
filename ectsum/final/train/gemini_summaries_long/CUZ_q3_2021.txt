Cousins Properties delivered strong financial results for Q3, including FFO of $0.69 per share. Same-property NOI rose 3.6% on a cash basis, and leasing activity was robust with over 597,000 square feet leased, 84% of which were new or expansion leases. Net effective rents reached $24.06 per square foot, higher than the 2019 average. Second-generation cash rents increased 23.1%, the strongest growth since 2015. The company's Sun Belt strategy continues to prove advantageous, with innovative companies recognizing the importance of in-person work and opting for quality office spaces in growing cities like Austin and Atlanta. The flight to quality is intensifying, with customers valuing amenity-rich environments for talent retention and culture-building. Cousins has assembled a trophy portfolio in fast-growing Sun Belt markets and has invested $1.1 billion in new acquisitions and development since the pandemic's onset, including Heights Union in Tampa. The company's solid balance sheet with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.54 times provides financial flexibility for future growth. Despite the ongoing pandemic and the Delta variant's impact on office utilization, the company remains optimistic about the future, relying on strong leasing activity and the expected recovery of its Sun Belt markets. The updated 2021 FFO guidance ranges from $2.73 to $2.77 per share, reflecting the continued return of customers to the office and the company's positive outlook.
