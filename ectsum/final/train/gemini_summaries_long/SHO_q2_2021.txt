Despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Aimbridge Hospitality's second quarter results exceeded expectations, with comparable 17-hotel portfolio revenues reaching $104 million and RevPAR at $96. RevPAR at all open hotels, including Montage Healdsburg, was $107, driven by strong leisure and commercial demand. Positive EBITDA was achieved each month of the quarter, leading to a return to corporate profitability three months ahead of schedule. Group business also improved, with 80,000 room nights in Q2 and positive trends continuing into Q3 and Q4. Forward booking trends are promising, with transient reservations only 10-15% below 2019 levels. Aimbridge recently acquired Montage Healdsburg, which has exceeded expectations with strong occupancy, room rates, and positive EBITDA in Q2. The company's strong balance sheet and increased debt capacity provide opportunities for further acquisitions of long-term relevant real estate.
