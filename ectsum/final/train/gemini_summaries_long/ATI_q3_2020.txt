ATI's Q3 financial performance significantly exceeded previous guidance, with an adjusted earnings per share loss of $0.38 due to aggressive cost savings initiatives and an improved product mix. The company variabilized its cost structure, allowing for better preparedness in demand fluctuations. Despite a 60% decline in commercial aerospace sales, a strong balance sheet and liquidity of approximately $950 million positions ATI to manage through the crisis and fuel future growth. Through strategic share gains and new business awards, ATI expects to benefit from engine market share gains and new airframe business in 2021. The defense market remains a source of strength with continued growth expected in the fourth quarter and into 2021. Additionally, the company anticipates modest growth trends in the electronic market and outperformance in the specialty energy market in the fourth quarter.
