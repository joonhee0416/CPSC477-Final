Despite inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions, Dollar General's third-quarter performance was strong, with net sales increasing by 3.9% to $8.5 billion. Comp sales declined by 0.6% year-over-year, but a 11.6% increase on a two-year stack basis. The company's strong performance can be attributed to customer growth and average basket size increases. They also saw market share gains in frozen and refrigerated product categories, while overall consumable product sales decreased slightly on a year-over-year basis.

Dollar General's operating profit declined by 13.9% to $665.6 million, but the company remains pleased with the 78 basis point improvement compared to Q3 2019. The decrease was primarily due to higher costs, including a LIFO provision, increased transportation costs, and inventory damages. Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased by 57 basis points but increased by 121 basis points compared to Q3 2019.

Looking ahead, Dollar General expects to execute 3,000 real estate projects in 2022, including 1,100 new store openings. The company is excited about the potential of its pOpshelf concept, which has exceeded expectations and will see its store count nearly tripled in 2022, with a target of 1,000 locations by fiscal year-end 2025. Dollar General is also planning to enter Mexico with a small number of stores and has introduced digital services, partnering with DoorDash for under-an-hour delivery in over 10,000 locations. The company anticipates challenges in the coming months due to uncertainties from the pandemic, but remains confident in its ability to navigate these pressures.
