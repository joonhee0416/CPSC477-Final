In Q3, NIKE reported a 5% revenue increase despite dynamic macroeconomic conditions, highlighting the effectiveness of its strategy. The growth was driven by double-digit growth in NIKE Direct, owing to the success of its portfolio of brands, relentless product innovation, and digital advantage. NIKE's connection with consumers remains strong, as evidenced by partnerships with renowned athletes, successful Olympic performances, and cultural events.

The company is doubling down on innovation, showcasing FlyEase technology across its product lines and expanding its sustainable initiatives with ISPA Link. To enhance consumer relationships, NIKE is implementing a new partnership model in Greater China that connects membership across online and offline channels, transforming the marketplace.

NIKE's digital strategy continues to drive growth, with the NIKE mobile app overtaking Nike.com on mobile for the highest share of digital demand. The company is leveraging new digital platforms for engagement, such as live streaming on SNKRS and virtual experiences on Roblox.

Despite supply chain disruptions, demand for NIKE brands remains high. The company is working to address challenges and optimize near-term performance while continuing to make progress on its Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy. Inventory supply is improving, and NIKE is leveraging Express Lane to make more locally relevant products available.

Wholesale partners continue to play an integral role in NIKE's market strategy, with focus on authenticating brands and creating scale. The company is investing in NIKE stores to address growth opportunities in women's apparel and Jordan. The new NIKE Live concept is showing promising profitability and will be tested further before scaling.

Financially, NIKE reported a strong quarter, with gross margin expanding due to favorable foreign exchange rates, higher full price mix, and lower markdowns. SG&A increased due to strategic technology investments and digital marketing. The company expects continued growth in fiscal '23, driven by strong brand strength, a robust product pipeline, and momentum in key growth drivers.
