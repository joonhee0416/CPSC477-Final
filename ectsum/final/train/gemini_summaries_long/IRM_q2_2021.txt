Iron Mountain's Q2 results exceeded expectations, with strong performance across its key markets. The company's revenue grew by 14% to $1.12 billion, with organic revenue increasing by 10%. The growth was driven by a strong recovery in service revenue, particularly in Global Digital Solutions and Secure IT Asset Disposition. Organic storage revenue also grew by 2.5%, driven by pricing and volume. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 17.6% to $406 million, benefiting from Project Summit savings and the revenue beat. Iron Mountain increased the midpoint of its 2021 financial guidance due to these strong results, the increased momentum in the business, and the acquisition of a small records management business in Morocco. The company now expects revenue to be in the range of $4.415 billion to $4.515 billion, adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.6 billion and $1.635 billion, and AFFO to be in the range of $970 million to $1.005 billion.
