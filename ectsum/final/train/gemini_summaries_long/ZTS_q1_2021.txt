In Q1 2021, Zoetis reported a strong start with revenue growth of 21% operationally, driven by companion animal products, with pet care and diagnostics portfolios showing particular strength. Companion animal products grew 34%, led by parasiticides and dermatology products, while livestock growth was 8% due to strong performance in cattle, swine, and fish. Simparica Trio, a triple combination parasiticide, exceeded expectations with 90% penetration in large U.S. accounts and drove growth in the small animal parasiticide portfolio. The diagnostics portfolio grew 47%, with advancements in point-of-care diagnostics and the VetScan images platform gaining positive customer feedback. International revenue grew 25% operationally, with China and Brazil leading the growth. Zoetis also anticipates approvals for Librela and Solensia, monoclonal antibodies for pain management in dogs and cats, in the U.S. in 2022. Despite expectations of normalized revenue growth in the second half of 2021 due to tough comparative periods and increased generic competition for DRAXXIN, Zoetis raised guidance for the full year with revenue projected at $7.5 billion to $7.625 billion and adjusted net income expected to be in the range of $2.12 billion to $2.16 billion, representing operational growth of 12% to 14%.
