Despite facing tough comparisons and consumer pantry loading last year, Colgate-Palmolive reported a strong first quarter with a 6% net sales growth. Organic sales increased by 5%, driven by volume and pricing, while foreign exchange provided a 1% tailwind. The company saw double-digit organic sales growth in emerging markets, particularly in Latin America and Asia Pacific. Premium innovation like Colgate Renewal and Colgate Enzyme Whitening Toothpaste contributed to growth in oral care. Despite higher raw materials and logistics costs, Colgate-Palmolive's focus on productivity helped drive gross margin expansion. SG&A expenses increased due to higher logistics costs and increased investment in advertising and growth initiatives. The company reiterated its financial guidance for the full year 2021, with organic sales expected to be within its long-term target range of 3% to 5%. Net sales are projected to grow by 4% to 7%, and the company expects to deliver earnings-per-share growth in the mid-to-high single-digit range on a base business basis.
