AIG had a strong start to 2021, with excellent performance in general insurance and continued solid results in life retirement. General insurance achieved an outstanding adjusted accident year combined ratio of 92.4%, a 310-basis-point improvement year over year. This was driven by improved loss and expense ratios, as well as AIG 200 savings. Net premiums written increased approximately 6%, with strong growth in global commercial, particularly in international and North America. Rate momentum continued with overall global commercial rate increases of 15%. Life retirement saw a 7.4% annualized adjusted return on common equity, with solid performance despite challenging market conditions. Progress was made on the separation of life retirement from AIG, with the intent to maximize value for stakeholders and position both companies for long-term success. AIG 200 transformation remained on track to deliver $1 billion in savings by the end of 2022, with significant progress made in the first quarter. The company's balance sheet and financial flexibility remain strong, allowing for focused growth, investments in technology, and capital returns to shareholders.
