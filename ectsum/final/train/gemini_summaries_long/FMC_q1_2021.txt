FMC's Q1 results were in line with expectations, with revenue of $1.2 billion, or 5% organic growth, and adjusted EPS of $1.53. The company saw double-digit sales growth in Asia, led by Australia and Japan. Two important product launches, Overwatch Herbicide and Xyway fungicide, exceeded expectations and contributed approximately $50 million in Q1 sales. FMC also announced an agreement with UPL to manufacture and distribute Rynaxypyr insect control. For the full year, FMC has increased its EPS forecast to $6.70 to $7.40, reflecting 14% year-over-year growth and an 8% increase in revenue, aided by organic growth and new products. The company projects strong growth in the second half, driven by favorable crop fundamentals, price increases, new products, and improved market access. Despite higher costs and supply chain constraints, FMC is confident in its growth trajectory and cash deployment plan, with plans to return over $135 million to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share repurchases and expects to return over $700 million in cash to shareholders this year.
