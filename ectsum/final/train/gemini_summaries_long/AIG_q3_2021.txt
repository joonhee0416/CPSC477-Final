AIG reported strong third quarter results, with adjusted after-tax income rising to $0.97 per share, driven by improved general insurance profitability and solid life and retirement performance. General insurance saw robust growth in net premiums written, especially in commercial lines, and achieved an impressive 90.5% accident year combined ratio excluding catastrophes. The company expects to reach its goal of a sub-90% accident year combined ratio for full year 2022. Life and retirement delivered strong earnings supported by stable markets and significant call and tender income. AIG remains committed to capital management, having reduced financial debt by $3.4 billion and returned $2.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends year-to-date. As part of its strategic priorities, AIG continues to work on the separation of life and retirement, which is expected to be completed through an IPO in 2022. The company also announced key leadership changes to further position it for long-term success.
