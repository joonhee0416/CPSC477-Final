Eagle Materials had a successful second quarter with a 14% increase in revenue and a 26% improvement in adjusted earnings per share. The company experienced strong demand in both its Cement and Wallboard businesses, driven by healthy housing construction and favorable supply-demand dynamics. Despite supply chain challenges, Eagle benefited from its ownership of raw materials and strategic hedging strategies. The company is also exploring initiatives to reduce its carbon footprint, including a partnership with Chart Industries on carbon capture technology. Eagle's financial position remains strong, with a well-structured debt maturity profile and continued share repurchases.
