PPG reported record Q4 sales of $4.2 billion, surpassing forecasts. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.26, impacted by lower-than-expected tax rates. Despite high sales, earnings missed guidance due to significant inflation (30% raw material cost increase), supply disruptions, and operational inefficiencies from COVID-related absenteeism (up to 40% in some facilities). The company experienced strong growth in PPG-Comex, protective and marine coatings, and automotive refinish. The acquired Tikkurila business also delivered record results. Challenges remain with supply chain disruptions, COVID-related absenteeism, and elevated costs (raw materials, labor, utilities), which are expected to continue into Q1. PPG plans to implement additional price increases to offset inflation. Despite these challenges, demand remains robust, and the company expects a gradual easing of supply chain issues and economic recovery in the second half of 2022. Catalysts for future earnings growth include recovery in automotive-related businesses, cost normalization, synergy capture from acquisitions, and organic growth. PPG aims for $9 per share earnings by 2023.
