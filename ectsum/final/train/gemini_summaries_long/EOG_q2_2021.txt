EOG's strong performance in the first half of the year showcases the success of its double-premium investment standard, which requires a minimum 60% direct after-tax rate of return using conservative commodity prices. This shift has positioned EOG for a step change in productivity and cost reductions. The company delivered adjusted earnings of $1.73 per share and $1.1 billion in free cash flow in the second quarter, reflecting exceptional operational performance with oil production exceeding guidance and capital expenditures below expectations. EOG continues to demonstrate its ability to sustainably lower costs in an inflationary environment, with well costs expected to be more than 7% lower than last year. The company remains committed to returning cash to shareholders through dividends, debt reduction, and bolt-on acquisitions while focusing on reducing GHG emissions and pursuing net-zero ambition by 2040 through a combination of emissions reduction, capture, and offset strategies.
