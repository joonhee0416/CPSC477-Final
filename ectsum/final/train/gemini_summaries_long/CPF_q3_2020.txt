Central Pacific's third-quarter earnings saw a $6.9 million net income, largely impacted by higher provision for credit loss expenses related to the pandemic. Despite this, pre-tax, pre-provision earnings experienced a slight increase to $23.7 million. The total loan portfolio grew by $27 million to $5.03 billion, with growth in several loan categories offset by declines in consumer and C&I loans. Criticized and special mentioned loans increased, while classified loans saw a slight increase. The allowance for credit losses rose to $80.5 million, or 1.79% of outstanding loans. The bank remains strongly capitalized, with a recently completed subordinated note offering strengthening capital ratios by an estimated 120 basis points. Despite Hawaii's recent uptick in COVID-19 cases, the state's tourism reopening has seen daily air arrival numbers increase, and the island of Oahu has moved to Tier 2 of its recovery plan, allowing for a further reopening of the economy.
