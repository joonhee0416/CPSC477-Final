Nabors Industries reported positive financial results in the third quarter, driven by a strong operating performance, increased activity in drilling and technology segments, and free cash flow exceeding expectations. Adjusted EBITDA reached $125 million, and revenue improved by 7% compared to the previous quarter. The US Lower 48 rig count increased by 4.1 to 67.6, maintaining strong daily margins of $7,025. International markets also contributed, with visibility for reactivation of rigs in Saudi Arabia and Latin America. Drilling Solutions and Rig Tech segments both saw growth, with EBITDA increasing by 22% and 17%, respectively. Nabors continues to make progress on its five key themes: leading US performance, international business upturn, technology innovation, sustainability, and deleveraging. The company highlighted the industry's first fully automated land rig, the PACE-R801, which has the potential to expand the pool of available workers and improve safety. Nabors' commitment to energy transition initiatives includes investments in geothermal and hydrogen technologies. The company remains vigilant to market disruptions but believes the current commodity environment supports increased drilling activity. Nabors expects further progress on debt reduction in the fourth quarter and 2022.
