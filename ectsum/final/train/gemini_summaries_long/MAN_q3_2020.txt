In the third quarter of 2020, ManpowerGroup reported revenue of $4.6 billion, a 14.5% decline year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, the company's results exceeded its guidance range, with an improved revenue decline compared to the second quarter. Excluding special items, operating profit reached $117 million, representing a 38% decrease in constant currency. The company saw a two-speed recovery in labor markets, with higher skilled workers recovering faster than lower skilled workers. ManpowerGroup's focus on strategic diversification, digitization, and innovation remains strong, with investments in Experis and Talent Solutions continuing to support future growth. Gross profit margin declined slightly, driven by lower contributions from permanent recruitment. SG&A expenses decreased significantly due to cost-cutting measures. In terms of geographical segments, Americas revenue fell by 11%, Southern Europe by 15%, Northern Europe by 22%, and Asia Pacific Middle East by 6%. Despite the overall revenue decline, ManpowerGroup generated strong free cash flow of $108 million in the third quarter and maintained a strong balance sheet with a net cash position of $500 million. For the fourth quarter, the company forecasts earnings per share between $1.06 and $1.14, a constant currency revenue decline of 10-12%, and an operating profit margin decline of 130 basis points compared to the prior year.
