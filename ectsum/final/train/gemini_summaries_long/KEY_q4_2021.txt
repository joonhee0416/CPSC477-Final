**Company Overview:**

Earnings per share were $0.64 or $2.63 for the year. Key highlights include record revenue, with a 9% increase year over year, and a record level of investment banking fees. The company expects continued growth in 2022, driven by a growth in net new households and a surge in loan originations.

**Financial Performance:**

For the fourth quarter, net income increased 14% year over year, with positive operating leverage. The company achieved record revenue and net interest income, and a return on tangible common equity of 18.7%. Net interest margin, however, was impacted by lower investment yields and the exit of the indirect auto loan portfolio.

**Risk and Capital Management:**

Credit quality remains strong, with net charge-offs at historically low levels. The company maintains a moderate risk profile, which has consistently positioned it well through business cycles. The common equity Tier 1 ratio is 9.4%, well within the target range of 9% to 9.5%. Capital returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases totaled 75% of net income in 2021.

**Outlook:**

The company expects low single-digit growth in average loans and deposits for 2022. Net interest income is expected to remain stable, and noninterest income is forecast to decline slightly, excluding prepaid card revenue. Noninterest expenses are projected to decrease, driven by investments in digital and analytics. Net charge-offs are expected to range from 20 to 30 basis points, with loss rates remaining below this range early in the year. The GAAP tax rate is estimated at 20%.
