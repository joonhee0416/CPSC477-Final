In 2020, despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, Oceaneering delivered improved consolidated adjusted operating results and EBITDA compared to the previous year. They generated $76 million of free cash flow, increasing their cash balance to $452 million. For 2021, they expect to generate positive free cash flow in excess of that generated in 2020. Their consolidated adjusted EBITDA is forecasted to be in the range of $160 million to $210 million, with positive operating income and adjusted EBITDA contributions from each operating segment. Despite lower revenue expected from their manufactured products segment, they anticipate generally flat consolidated revenue due to higher revenue in ADTech and IMDS segments. Their Subsea Robotics segment is expected to have improved results based on higher ROV days and generally stable pricing, while their Offshore Projects Group is forecasted to improve due to efficiency measures and contributions from their Angola project.
