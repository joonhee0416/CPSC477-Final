HII reported solid Q2 results with revenues increasing to $2.2 billion from $2.0 billion in the previous year's second quarter. Diluted earnings per share climbed significantly to $3.20 from $1.30, with adjusted earnings per share standing at $3.05. New contract awards of $1.2 billion contributed to a backlog of $48 billion, including $24 billion in funded contracts. Construction of LHA 8, DDG 125, and other vessels progresses steadily. Technical Solutions, despite portfolio adjustments, secured key contracts for unmanned underwater vehicles and support services for aircraft carriers. Noteworthy was the agreement to acquire Alion Science and Technology, enhancing HII's defense and federal solutions capabilities. Ingalls reported increased revenues and operating income driven by DDG and LHA programs. Newport News saw revenue growth in both submarine and aircraft carrier construction, while Technical Solutions recorded a revenue decline due to business portfolio restructuring. The full-year shipbuilding margin is now estimated within the range of 7.5% to 8%.
