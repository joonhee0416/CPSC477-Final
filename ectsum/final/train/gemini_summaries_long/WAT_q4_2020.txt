Waters Corporation reported strong results for Q4 2020, with revenue growth of 10%, driven primarily by the pharmaceutical market. Growth was widespread across geographies, with Asia posting double-digit gains and strong performances in Europe and the Americas. While mass spec sales remained relatively flat, LC Instruments grew in most major markets, signaling stabilization in LC instrument demand. The company's near-term growth initiatives, including the instrument replacement program and expansion of contract lab relationships, are gaining traction and contributing to revenue growth. Looking ahead to 2021, Waters anticipates a gradual improvement in customer activity, led by the pharmaceutical market, and strong growth in China. The company expects full-year constant currency sales growth of 5% to 8% and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $9.32 to $9.57. Waters is well-positioned for growth based on its resilient team, strong product portfolio, and ongoing transformation program.
