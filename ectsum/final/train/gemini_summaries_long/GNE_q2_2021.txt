Genie Energy, an energy company with operations in retail and renewables, emphasized its differentiated business model and strong financial position. The company's retail energy business, primarily in the U.S., generates significant revenue and profits. Its growth strategy involves opportunistically expanding market share and introducing new products. In international markets, Genie Energy has established a presence in the U.K. and Scandinavia, with plans to expand further. The company's renewable energy business has potential for growth, with a focus on capturing a larger share of the value chain. To enhance shareholder value, Genie Energy is evaluating a potential spin-off of its international operations, believing that the combined company is undervalued. Financially, Genie Energy reported strong second-quarter results, with consolidated revenue increasing 28% to $98 million and earnings per share improving to $0.19. The company's balance sheet remains robust, providing flexibility for future growth investments.
