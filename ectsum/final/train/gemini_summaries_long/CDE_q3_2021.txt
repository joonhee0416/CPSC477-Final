Coeur Mining's third quarter showcased progress towards their goal of sustainable cash flow and long-term value creation. Despite lower silver prices and inflationary pressures, the company maintains its production guidance and expects a strong finish to the year. Palmarejo and Kensington exceeded expectations, while Rochester made significant progress in preparing for the POA 11 expansion, which is now estimated to incur a 10-15% cost increase. While the Silvertip expansion has been delayed due to macroeconomic factors, the company remains confident in its potential and is evaluating a larger, slower-timed approach. The quarter also marked a significant milestone with Wharf achieving a year without recordable safety incidents. Coeur's commitment to diversity and inclusion continues, with the Head of Human Resources receiving an industry award. Exploration investments remain robust, with $70 million budgeted for 2021, leading to double-digit reserve and resource growth over the past few years. The company retains a strong liquidity position with approximately $330 million and plans to maintain a net leverage ratio below 2 times and liquidity above $100 million during the Rochester expansion. Coeur's focus for the remainder of the year includes achieving full-year production targets, capturing growth potential at Palmarejo, advancing the POA 11 expansion, and continuing exploration efforts.
