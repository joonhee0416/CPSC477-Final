Regis Corporation, in the midst of a multiphase transformation, reported progress towards its goal of transitioning to a fully franchised business model. Despite a 24% decline in revenue, the company anticipates completion of this transition by year-end. This transformation has led to aggressive expense reductions, including a $19 million G&A cut. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 70% of Regis' portfolio was franchised, with 50% of the remaining company-owned salons in various stages of transition. During the second quarter, Regis converted 988 salons to franchise ownership, and expects to complete the sale of approximately 900 additional salons. The company's adjusted EBITDA declined by 17.5% to $17 million, primarily due to the elimination of EBITDA from sold salons. Regis aims to achieve a cash flow positive run rate in the fourth quarter and has engaged Guggenheim Securities to redesign its capital structure to better suit its franchise business model.
