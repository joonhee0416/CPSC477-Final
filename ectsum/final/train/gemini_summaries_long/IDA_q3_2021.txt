IDACORP reported its third-quarter earnings with a modest decrease of $0.09 per share compared to last year, resulting in earnings per diluted share of $1.93. However, the company achieved the highest nine-month earnings in its history, with earnings per diluted share of $4.20. The revised full-year guidance range is now $4.80 to $4.90 per diluted share, based on normal weather conditions and a continued economic recovery. Customer growth has surged by 2.9%, driven by Idaho Power's reliable and affordable energy, attracting businesses and residents. To meet growing demand, the company plans to add approximately $100 million in additional capital expenditures related to the 80-megawatt project and other resources, including a 120-megawatt solar project and the Boardman to Hemingway transmission line. Despite higher power supply costs during the summer heat wave, strong sales have been reported across most customer classes. The company continues to monitor the regulatory environment, recently suspending a rate request to assess the potential conversion of the Jim Bridger coal-fired power plant to natural gas generation. IDACORP maintains strong financial health with investment-grade credit ratings and sound liquidity, enabling it to fund capital expenditures and distribute dividends to shareholders.
