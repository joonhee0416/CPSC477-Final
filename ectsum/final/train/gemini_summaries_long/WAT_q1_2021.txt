In Q1, the company reported strong financial results, with a 31% increase in sales to $609 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share surged 99% to $2.29. This growth was driven by strength across end markets, particularly pharma. The company's transformation plan is making progress, with initiatives such as instrument replacement and e-commerce driving commercial momentum. Additionally, changes in leadership and the establishment of an Innovation Board will further strengthen the organization. Moving forward, the company expects continued growth in 2021, with full-year constant-currency sales growth projected in the range of 8% to 11%. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be $9.85 to $10.05. However, growth is expected to be stronger in the first half of the year due to more challenging comparisons and fewer calendar days in the fourth quarter.
