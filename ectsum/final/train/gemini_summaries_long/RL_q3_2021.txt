Ralph Lauren's Q3 performance reflects strong underlying progress in its path towards quality growth despite challenges posed by COVID-19. Revenue improved sequentially, with digital sales accelerating across all regions, contributing to over 20% growth year-over-year. Asia exhibited robust recovery, driven by continued momentum in China (+40% reported growth), while North America remained relatively stable. Europe faced headwinds due to government-mandated shutdowns and operating restrictions. Gross and operating margins expanded due to AUR growth and cost discipline, while digital profitability exceeded expectations. The company is optimistic about the future, due to ongoing efforts to elevate the brand, invest in strategic areas, and streamline operations. It expects a gradual recovery as vaccines roll out, and plans to reinvest savings from its Strategic Realignment Plan in future growth. However, COVID-19 remains a near-term headwind, and Q4 revenue is projected to decline mid-to-high single digits due to ongoing lockdowns and restrictions.
