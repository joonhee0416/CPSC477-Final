Sonic Automotive reported an impressive Q3 with record revenues of $3.1 billion, up 21%, driven by strong performance across its Franchised Dealerships and EchoPark segments. Franchised Dealerships saw a 11% same-store revenue growth and a 27% increase in gross profit, while EchoPark achieved all-time high quarterly revenues of $663 million, representing a 72% year-over-year surge. Despite supply chain disruptions impacting new vehicle inventory, Franchised Dealerships remained profitable, achieving a record SG&A expense as a percentage of gross profit of 68.1%. EchoPark, however, faced margin pressures due to higher used vehicle wholesale pricing but remains confident in its long-term potential and is on track to launch its digital retail platform by the end of the year. The company's recent acquisitions, including RFJ Auto Partners, are expected to contribute $3.2 billion in annual revenues and expand its geographic coverage. With improved liquidity and a strong balance sheet, Sonic declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per share.
