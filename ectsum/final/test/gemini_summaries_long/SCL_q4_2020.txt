Despite the global pandemic, Stepan Company delivered record full year earnings, driven by strong demand for cleaning, disinfection, and personal wash products in the consumer segment. Fourth quarter adjusted net income rose 29% year-over-year to $33.1 million, with diluted earnings per share increasing to $1.42. Surfactant segment operating income surged 28%, while Polymer segment also saw growth, largely due to an insurance recovery. Specialty Product operating income remained steady. For the full year, adjusted net income reached $132 million, an 11% increase from 2019. Stepan's strong balance sheet enabled the acquisition of INVISTA's aromatic polyester polyol business, expected to slightly boost earnings and EBITDA margins. Additionally, the company acquired a fermentation plant to develop new biosurfactants with enhanced sustainability features. Stepan remains optimistic about its future prospects, focusing on meeting increased demand in consumer products, expanding capacity, and pursuing strategic acquisitions.
