Greenhill reported a solid start to the year with $68.9 million in revenue, a 3% increase year-over-year. Operating profit and earnings per share surpassed last year's losses, reaching $7.2 million and $0.09 respectively. M&A activity is particularly strong in the U.S., where it's surpassing pre-pandemic levels. While restructuring activity remains subdued, the firm is expanding into financing advisory work. The private capital advisory market is thriving, particularly in Europe and Asia, prompting the company to invest in building a global team for this segment. The company has accelerated debt payments and progressed towards its recruiting goals. While compensation costs were lower, the compensation ratio exceeded the target range. Non-compensation costs and interest expense are trending down. The company paid a dividend and repurchased shares. With $35.5 million in repurchase authority remaining, the focus remains on deleveraging while also enhancing shareholder value melalui share buybacks.
