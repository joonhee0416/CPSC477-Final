Clorox concluded fiscal 2021 with a 9% sales growth despite challenges like rising inflation, supply chain disruptions, and moderating demand for cleaning and disinfecting products. While sales declined by 9% in Q4, year-over-year sales still grew by 13%. The company delivered a 61% decline in adjusted earnings per share due to lower sales and higher costs, leading to a decrease in gross margin of 970 basis points. Despite headwinds, the company remains committed to its IGNITE strategy, which includes fuel growth, personalization, innovation, digital transformation, and ESG initiatives. In fiscal 2022, Clorox anticipates a sales decline of 2% to 6%, with ongoing demand moderation, higher trade spending, and unfavorable mix expected to be offset by pricing actions. Gross margin is projected to decline by 300 to 400 basis points, while selling and administrative expenses are expected to increase to 15% of sales. Adjusted earnings per share is forecasted to range between $5.40 and $5.70.
