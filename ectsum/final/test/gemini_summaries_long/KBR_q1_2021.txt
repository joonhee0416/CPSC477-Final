In Q1, KBR reported revenues of $1.5 billion, inline with its full-year guidance, and adjusted EBITDA of $135 million. Despite disruptions in the Middle East, Government Solutions (GS) recorded 19% top-line growth, driven by readiness and sustainment programs. Sustainable Technology Solutions (STS) made notable progress, posting a strong quarter in bookings for proprietary process technologies like K-COT, K-PRO, and K-SAAT. Notably, STS's margins have significantly improved year-over-year due to a better business mix and cost reductions. Despite a shift in revenue profile, with reduced Middle East contingency work and a higher proportion of advanced technology contracts, KBR reiterates its full-year guidance and anticipates a 20% increase in adjusted earnings per share.
