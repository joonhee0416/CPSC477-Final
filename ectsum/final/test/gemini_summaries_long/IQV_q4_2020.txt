IQVIA reported strong fourth-quarter results, with double-digit growth in key financial metrics. Revenue for the quarter was $3,298 million, exceeding guidance by $108 million, driven by organic performance and favorable foreign exchange. Fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA grew 14.5% to $735 million, also exceeding guidance. These strong results were driven by increased demand for technology offerings, such as OCE and HCP Engagement Management, as well as continued resilience in Real World services. The R&D Solutions segment won over 60 new studies using Virtual Trials technology and saw a significant increase in contracted backlog, which now stands at $22.6 billion. The company is optimistic about 2021, raising its guidance for revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted diluted earnings per share. IQVIA expects continued growth in its TAS and R&DS segments, margin expansion, and a further reduction in net leverage. Overall, IQVIA's strong fourth-quarter results and positive outlook reflect the company's success in adapting to the challenges of the pandemic and continuing to provide innovative solutions to its clients.
