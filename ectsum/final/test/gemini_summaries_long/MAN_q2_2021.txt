The company's operating profit increased significantly to $170 million, with an operating profit margin of 3.2%, reflecting the positive impact of foreign currency and improved operational performance.

The Manpower brand experienced the most significant growth, recovering from a decline a year ago. Experis brand and Talent Solutions also posted solid organic growth, driven by increased hiring activity and RPO services. SG&A expenses rose by 17% year-over-year in constant currency, indicating balanced investment. For the third quarter, ManpowerGroup forecasts a total revenue growth of 14% to 18%, with ongoing improvement in key regions like France, Italy, and the U.S. The company expects a slight decrease in revenue in Mexico due to recent labor legislation but anticipates a shift towards specialized staffing, improving the margin profile of its Mexican business.
