Flowserve reported solid second-quarter results, with adjusted earnings per share of $0.37, a 32% improvement sequentially. Bookings surged 17.9% year-over-year to $953 million, primarily driven by aftermarket and MRO businesses. The company raised its full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance to $1.45-$1.65, reflecting confidence in its growth prospects. Key factors contributing to this optimism include expected project activity growth in the back half of the year and a focus on energy transition, where Flowserve estimates it generates $100-$150 million in annual revenue. The improved operational performance and a consistent operating model through Flowserve 2.0 lay the foundation for ongoing productivity improvements and margin expansion in the future.
