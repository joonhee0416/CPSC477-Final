Stepan delivered a solid first half, achieving record earnings. Adjusted net income for the first half was $84.6 million, up 35% year-over-year. The second quarter saw a 10% increase in adjusted net income to $42.2 million, primarily driven by growth in Polymer and Specialty Products. Surfactant income declined by 5% due to higher supply chain costs. The integration of the INVISTA polyester polyol acquisition into Polymer operations has proceeded smoothly, contributing to a 48% increase in Polymer operating income. Specialty Products also reported growth in both sales and operating income. Stepan is implementing capacity expansions for biocides and amphoterics and working to increase customer penetration in Tier 2 and Tier 3 markets. The company anticipates continued demand for disinfection products and growth in institutional cleaning, agricultural, and oilfield markets. Long-term prospects for Polyols remain positive due to energy efficiency efforts and stricter building codes. Management expects a cautious recovery for Surfactant volumes in the North American consumer market but believes Specialty Products results will improve year-over-year. The company remains optimistic about the remainder of the year despite inflationary pressures.
