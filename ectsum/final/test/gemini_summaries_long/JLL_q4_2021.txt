JLL reported a strong finish to 2021, with record fourth-quarter revenue of $5.9 billion, a 23% increase, and fee revenue growth of 42% to $2.8 billion. This growth was primarily driven by robust performance in leasing and capital markets, which recorded a combined 68% increase in fee revenue compared to the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA rose by 50% to $622 million, with a margin expansion to 22.4%. The company's three-year transformation process, which streamlined operations and integrated its global services, has enabled JLL to reduce structural complexities and enhance growth. The positive market outlook, characterized by increased investment in the commercial real estate industry and high levels of liquidity, bodes well for JLL's continued growth in 2022. However, the company remains cautious about the potential impact of geopolitical events in Ukraine and tight labor markets. Despite these challenges, JLL's strong balance sheet, solid cash flow, and investments in its global platform and capabilities position it well to navigate the current environment and deliver long-term shareholder value.
