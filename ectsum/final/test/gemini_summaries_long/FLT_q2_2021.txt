In Q2 of 2021, the company reported outstanding financial results, with revenue of $667 million (up 27%) and cash earnings per share of $3.15 (up 38%). Organic revenue growth was 23%, with strong contributions from the full AP outsourcing platform segment (up 53%). The company saw record retention levels (94%) and a strong recovery in same-store sales (up 18%). Credit losses remain low, and sales outstanding were up significantly.

For the full year, the company raised its guidance, with revenue expected between $2.745 billion to $2.79 billion and cash earnings per share between $12.80 and $13.00. The guidance implies revenue growth of approximately 20% over last year and high single-digits above the 2019 baseline, with record sales and profits expected.

Two recent acquisitions, AFEX and ALE, are expected to contribute significantly, with incremental cash earnings per share in the $0.50 to $0.70 range in 2022. The company believes the fuel card business has a bright future, despite the transition to EVs, and highlights opportunities in monetizing EV adoption, expanding digital sales, and transforming the fuel card UI into a broader payment platform.
