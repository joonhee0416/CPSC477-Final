Capital One delivered strong results in Q4 2020, reporting net income of $2.6 billion ($5.35 per share) and full-year earnings per share of $5.18. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $5.29, excluding certain items. The company released $593 million in allowance, primarily in its card business, citing strong credit performance and the $900 billion stimulus package. Despite a modest decline in coverage levels, they remain elevated above pre-pandemic levels.

Capital One's liquidity position remained robust, with a preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio of 145% during the fourth quarter. Net interest margin increased to 6.05%, driven by higher card loan revenue margin due to strong credit results. The company's Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio stood at 13.7%, exceeding their target of 11%, resulting in the announcement of a restored quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share and a share repurchase program of up to $7.5 billion.

Exceptional credit performance drove strong results in Capital One's Domestic Card business, with a significant improvement in charge-off and delinquency rates. Consumer spending rebounded, leading to a 10% increase in purchase volume from the previous quarter and revenue growth of 7%. Marketing expenses remained depressed, driven by the impact of the pandemic.

Auto loans in the Consumer Banking segment grew, driven by the auto market's recovery and the company's digital products and services. Deposits continued to surge, fueled by stimulus-driven inflows. Credit performance remained strong, with low charge-off and delinquency rates benefiting from positive auction values and temporary impacts of COVID-related forbearance.

Commercial Banking saw growth in certain segments, but faced challenges in the oil and gas portfolio. Provision for credit losses improved, driven by an allowance release. Overall, the company's net interest margin declined, but revenue grew due to higher loan and deposit volumes.
