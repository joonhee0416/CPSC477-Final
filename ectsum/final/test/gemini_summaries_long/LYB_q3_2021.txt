LyondellBasell reported a strong quarter with earnings per share of $5.25 and EBITDA of $2.7 billion, a significant increase year-over-year. The company's Olefins and Polyolefins-Americas segment drove results, with record high polypropylene spreads. The Advanced Polymer Solutions segment faced supply chain constraints, resulting in lower margins and volumes. However, the Refining segment saw improved margins and an increased demand for gasoline. LyondellBasell is optimistic about future demand, citing pent-up consumer spending and the roll-out of vaccination programs globally. The company has made significant growth investments in recent years and expects to continue reinvesting in accretive investments and share repurchases. LyondellBasell remains committed to reducing its debt by $4 billion before the end of the year and maintaining its investment-grade credit rating while prioritizing dividend payments.
