E-commerce played a significant role, with sales surging over 110% year-over-year and 124% since 2019. The company's strategy of differentiating its banners and optimizing assortments has contributed to double-digit revenue growth in all U.S. banners. Signet is also making progress in expanding its services, which are returning to pre-pandemic levels and offer a strong growth opportunity. The company is investing in accessible luxury and value through its mid-market brands, with Piercing Pagoda delivering a record-breaking quarter. Signet's leadership in digital commerce is evident in its significant online sales growth and the integration of digital and physical experiences. The company is investing heavily in growth initiatives, including talent, banner differentiation, and technology, and has reinstated a common dividend to return cash to shareholders.
