KAR Global delivered solid financial performance in Q2 despite facing headwinds in vehicle supply, particularly from commercial sellers. The constrained supply environment led to a 40% decrease in commercial vehicle sales compared to Q2 2019, a decline that KAR's performance outpaced, indicating market share retention. However, KAR anticipates an improvement in commercial supply over time, driven by a recovery in off-lease, repossessed, and rental vehicles. Dealer consignment volumes have returned to pre-COVID levels, and digital dealer-to-dealer platforms saw strong growth. Despite lower volumes, KAR's gross profit margin reached 51.7%, with gross profit per vehicle sold increasing to $277 in the ADESA segment. SG&A expenses were managed effectively, with sequential declines in ADESA SG&A. AFC, KAR's finance business, continued to perform well, driven by higher revenue per loan transaction. Overall, management remains optimistic about the company's prospects as the cyclical return of commercial seller volumes presents opportunities for increased profitability.
