CNA Financial reported strong underlying business performance in Q3, with an improved combined ratio and growth in new business. Premium growth exceeded the second quarter, with rate increases continuing to accelerate. The underlying loss ratio and expense ratio also improved. The company has conservatively modified its discount rate assumptions for its long-term care reserves due to the lower interest rate environment, resulting in a pre-tax impact of $609 million. However, favorable changes in morbidity, persistency, and rate increase assumptions partially offset this impact. Overall, the Life & Group segment had a core loss of $35 million, while the Corporate segment saw a core loss of $19 million. Despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, CNA's portfolio performed well, with an increase in its unrealized gain position and strong net investment income. The company maintains a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity, and remains optimistic about the ongoing hard market conditions.
