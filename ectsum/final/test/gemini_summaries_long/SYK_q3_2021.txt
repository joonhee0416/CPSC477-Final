During Q3, the company reported organic sales growth of 8.4% driven by strong performances in MedSurg and Neurotechnology, offset by a slowdown in elective procedures affecting hip, knee, and spine sales due to the resurgence of COVID-19. International organic growth of 12% outpaced US growth, with strong performances in Europe, Australia, Canada, and emerging markets. Despite the headwinds, the company's MedSurg and Neurotechnology segments continued to perform well, with double-digit growth in both. The Trauma and Extremities business, including Wright Medical, delivered 3.2% comparable growth, with double-digit growth in upper extremities. Due to ongoing COVID-related volatility and hospital staffing shortages, the company updated its full-year organic sales growth guidance to 7% to 8% and adjusted net earnings per diluted share to $9.08 to $9.15. Despite these challenges, the company remains confident in its long-term prospects as the pandemic recedes and expects its strategies and strong fundamentals to drive future growth.
