Campbell's reported lower-than-expected third quarter earnings, with an adjusted EPS of $0.57. Despite the drop, the company remains positive about its long-term performance. In Meals & Beverages, sales declined as consumers shifted away from pandemic-driven elevated demand. However, the division gained market share in key categories such as soup, sauce, and broth. Snacks, despite being down year-over-year, sustained a strong performance with continued growth in its power brands like Kettle Brand, Goldfish, and Pepperidge Farm. The company is addressing inflationary pressures, supply chain challenges, and execution issues to improve margins. Campbell's has revised its guidance for fiscal 2021: net sales are expected to decline by 1.2% to 0.7%, adjusted EBIT by 4% to 5%, and adjusted EPS by 1% to 2%. Despite these challenges, the company remains confident in its strategic plan and expects to unlock its full potential as it addresses current headwinds and demonstrates sustainable growth.
