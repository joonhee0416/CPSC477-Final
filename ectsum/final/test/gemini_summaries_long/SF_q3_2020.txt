Stifel recorded a strong third quarter, with an 8% increase in net revenue to $883 million, driven by strength in capital raising, trading activity, and fee-based assets. Despite a pullback in advisory revenue and net interest, wealth management revenue grew 4% to $527 million, supported by rebounding asset management and service fees, and improved brokerage revenue that offset an 11% decline in net interest income. Wealth advisor recruiting accelerated, building on momentum from the first half. In the Institutional Group, net revenue surged 25% to $363 million, driven by record capital raising and brokerage growth, which more than compensated for a decline in advisory revenue. Overall, Stifel's diversified business mix continues to drive growth, with a focus on synergy and a 46% contribution to net revenue from Wealth Management over the past 12 months. Credit quality remains strong at Stifel Bank, with nonperforming assets and loans holding steady at 8 basis points. The company forecasts fourth-quarter net revenues between $870 million and $920 million, and pre-tax margins improved 160 basis points to 19.4% in the third quarter.
