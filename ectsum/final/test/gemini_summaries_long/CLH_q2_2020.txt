In Q2, Clean Harbors faced challenges but exceeded expectations with revenues of $710 million, down 18% from last year. Adjusted EBITDA came in at $135.5 million, including $23.4 million from government assistance programs. Environmental Services revenue declined 12%, but adjusted EBITDA grew 17% due to cost reduction efforts and increased incineration and decontamination work. Safety-Kleen saw a 30% revenue decline due to business closures and lower demand for base oil, although adjusted EBITDA was partially offset by government assistance programs. Despite the pandemic, Clean Harbors remains resilient with a strong cash position and proactive cost management initiatives. The company expects adjusted EBITDA for 2020 to range from $470 million to $500 million, supported by cost reductions and the COVID-19 decontamination service offering.
