In Q2 2020, the bank reported a net income of $14.3 million or $0.22 per share, a decrease from the $0.38 per share reported in Q2 2019. The net interest margin decreased by 0.23% primarily due to lower rates, higher cash balances, and growth in noninterest-bearing deposits. The provision for loan losses was $10.9 million, reflecting the impact of CECL and the recessionary economic forecast. Asset quality improved, with net recoveries and a decline in nonperforming assets. The loan pipeline remains robust at $1.3 billion, and residential mortgage originations have spiked due to low rates. Despite the challenges of COVID-19, the bank's capital structure and balance sheet strength remain strong. The Board approved a $0.23 cash dividend.
