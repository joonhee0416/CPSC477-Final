Albemarle experienced stable growth in Q3, with net sales of $831 million and adjusted EBITDA of $218 million, despite the sale of Fast Charging Solutions (FCS) last year. Excluding FCS, net sales increased by 19%, and EBITDA rose by 14%. The company has made significant progress in its lithium growth strategy, achieving first lithium carbonate production at La Negra III and IV in late October and announcing the acquisition of Guangxi Tianyuan New Energy Materials, which will accelerate conversion capacity growth. Albemarle has also invested in two greenfield conversion sites in China and restarted the Wodgina Lithium Mine in Western Australia. Despite labor shortages and pandemic-related travel restrictions impacting project completion, Albemarle remains committed to executing its robust global project pipeline.
