Western Union saw a strong Q3 with 2% reported revenue growth, driven by 15% growth in digital and 31% growth in Business Solutions. Digital revenue remained robust, maintaining the record high set last quarter and on pace to surpass $1 billion this year. The company's account-to-account business, which is the fastest-growing segment, performed particularly well. Western Union's omnichannel platform enables payouts to over 200 countries and territories in more than 130 currencies through its extensive network of bank accounts, wallets, cards, and retail locations. Despite economic challenges, Business Solutions revenue rose 31%, with growth driven by increased payment services activity and the education vertical. Western Union expects full-year 2021 constant currency revenue (excluding Argentina inflation) to grow 3-4%, and adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.05 to $2.10.
