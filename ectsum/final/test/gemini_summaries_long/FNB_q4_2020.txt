In 2020, FNB witnessed substantial growth, posting strong financials and executing strategic initiatives. Despite pandemic challenges, FNB reported a record total revenue of $1.2 billion and a tangible book value per share increase of 5% to $7.88. Notably, full year average loan and deposit growth were 11% and 14%, respectively, driven by strong loan origination targets and successful expansion in Southeastern markets. FNB's fee-based businesses, including capital markets, mortgage banking, and wealth management, contributed significantly to revenue with combined income exceeding $300 million. The loan portfolio performed satisfactorily, with delinquency and NPL levels both improving despite the challenging environment. FNB proactively reduced exposure to COVID-impacted industries, resulting in an improvement in credit metrics. The company also achieved cost savings of $20 million in 2020 and plans to reduce expenses by an additional $21 million in 2021. FNB is optimistic about the economic outlook and expects loan growth, deposit increases, and a slight reduction in expenses for the full year of 2021.
