Carpenter Technology's second-quarter results met expectations despite ongoing inventory reductions and market headwinds. The company's strategic focus on safety, cash flow generation, and customer relationships remains intact. They generated $51 million of free cash flow in Q2, bringing their fiscal year-to-date total to $114 million. Their total liquidity now stands at $665 million, including $271 million in cash. Growth in the aerospace and defense end-use market is expected, with customer agreements emphasizing the limited supply and strong fundamentals of aerospace materials. Carpenter Technology continues to invest in critical emerging technologies, with their hot strip mill in Reading now in the commissioning phase to support the growing electrification trend. While near-term demand in the aerospace and defense end-use market remains choppy, the company expects a demand reset to higher levels as customers adjust to OEM demand. The medical end-use market is also recovering, with restocking actions anticipated to drive incremental bottom-line impact. Carpenter Technology's strong position in soft magnetics, coupled with the launch of the Carpenter Electrification brand and the commissioning of the hot strip mill, positions the company for accelerated growth in the emerging electrification market.
