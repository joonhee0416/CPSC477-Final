Key strategic developments in the quarter include partnerships with Accenture, Alibaba, Tempered Networks, and Phylagen to enhance cybersecurity, indoor environmental quality, and building sustainability. Johnson Controls aims to capitalize on secular trends such as healthy buildings, decarbonization, and smart connected equipment. In fiscal 2022, the company expects high single-digit organic revenue growth, 70-80 basis points of segment EBITA margin expansion, and adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3.22-$3.32, representing 22%-25% growth year-over-year.
