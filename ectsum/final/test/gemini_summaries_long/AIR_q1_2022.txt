In Q1, the company reported strong results despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Sales rose 14% to $455 million, driven by a 52% increase in commercial sales. Adjusted earnings per share surged 206% to $0.52. The robust demand for airframe MRO services and parts businesses fueled this growth. The company's operating margin improved from 5.2% in Q4 to 5.5% in Q1, highlighting its cost optimization efforts. Furthermore, the company generated $18 million in operating cash flow and reduced its accounts receivable financing program usage. It secured several new business wins, including an exclusive distribution agreement with Arkwin and a contract with the Department of Energy. The company's strong balance sheet, with net debt of $80.2 million and a net leverage ratio of 0.6x, positions it well for future growth. Despite the impact of the Afghanistan withdrawal on its Expeditionary Services segment, the company expects stable performance for Q2 and remains optimistic about its long-term growth prospects, relying on its enhanced operating leverage and a solid government and commercial pipeline.
