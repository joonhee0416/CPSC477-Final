In the second quarter of 2021, the company reported strong financial performance with a 6.9% increase in comparable store sales and a 200% increase in non-GAAP earnings per share to $2.21. This growth was driven by strong demand for footwear and apparel, coupled with higher average selling prices and a reduction in markdowns. Despite ongoing supply chain challenges and the impact of temporary store closures due to COVID-19, the company remained optimistic about the outlook for the back half of 2021. The company also announced the acquisition of WSS and atmos, which are expected to contribute to further growth and accretion in the coming years. Additionally, the company increased its quarterly dividend by 50%, demonstrating confidence in its financial strength and future prospects.
