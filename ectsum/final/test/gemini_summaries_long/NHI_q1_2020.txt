National Health Investors (NHI) reported mixed financial results for Q1 2020, citing challenges faced due to COVID-19. Despite an increase in earnings per share and FFO metrics, the company observed a decline in inquiries, tours, and move-ins, leading to an impact on occupancy. However, NHI's operators have done an admirable job in limiting the spread of the virus, with less than 1% of residents having active cases as of May 5th. The company has enhanced occupancy disclosure for certain operators and is committed to transparency with investors. While costs have risen for operators, NHI remains prepared to support them. The company saw a 9.2% increase in cash NOI, driven by organic growth and investments. NHI's balance sheet remains strong, with low leverage and ample liquidity. Despite market challenges, the company is exploring growth opportunities and has the necessary financial flexibility to navigate the current environment. NHI remains grateful for the efforts of operators and front-line workers in combating COVID-19.
