Oil States International reported a consolidated $141 million in revenue for Q3 2021, with an adjusted consolidated EBITDA of $8.5 million. Despite a 64% increase in Offshore/Manufactured Products bookings and a book-to-bill ratio of 1.5, results were impacted by Hurricane Ida, resulting in an estimated $6 million revenue and $3 million EBITDA shortfall. However, this impact is considered transitory and should be recovered in future quarters. The company remained cash-positive with $68 million on hand and $129 million in available liquidity. Offshore/Manufactured Products segment witnessed a 10% revenue decline due to Hurricane Ida's impact on manufacturing and sales, but backlog increased by 16%. Conversely, Downhole Technologies experienced a 5% revenue dip due to international order delays, while Well Site Services saw revenue growth driven by increased U.S. land-based completion activity. The company anticipates a 15%+ sequential revenue growth in Q4, primarily led by Offshore/Manufactured Products.
