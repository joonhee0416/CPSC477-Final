Hormel Foods posted record sales for the second quarter, driven by a 28% recovery in its foodservice business. Despite higher raw material costs, the company reaffirmed its full-year earnings per share guidance range of $1.70 to $1.82. Within its segments, Refrigerated Foods saw strong growth, particularly in pizza toppings and value-added products, while International delivered its fifth consecutive quarter of record earnings growth. Retail and deli also performed well, with key brands like SPAM and Applegate showing growth compared to pre-pandemic levels. Jennie-O Turkey Store faced challenges due to higher feed costs, but a recovery in foodservice demand and increased whole bird sales contributed to a 2% sales increase. To mitigate input cost pressures, Hormel Foods has taken pricing actions and secured grain cost hedges for the remainder of the year. The company expects elevated and volatile market conditions in the balance of the year, but remains confident in its ability to navigate these challenges and continue growing.
