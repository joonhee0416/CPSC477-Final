In a challenging fiscal 2020 marked by the pandemic, the company exceeded its strategic goals, including 10% adjusted EBITDA growth, a return on assets above 10%, and a net debt-to-EBITDA below five times. This exceptional performance is attributed to the company's talented team and product simplification. Entering 2021 with a 50% increase in backlog, the company anticipates ongoing new home demand. To support growth objectives, the company will allocate its profitability and cash generation to land acquisition and community count growth. This change in capital allocation posture marks a shift from the previous focus on debt retirement and financial risk reduction. For the first quarter of fiscal 2021, the company projects flat orders, slightly longer cycle times, higher ASPs, and increased gross margins. Despite higher lumber prices in the second quarter, overall earnings per share are expected to significantly increase due to higher EBITDA and lower interest expense.
