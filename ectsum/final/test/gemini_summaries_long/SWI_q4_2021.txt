SolarWinds exceeded expectations in Q4 2021, reporting $186.7 million in revenue and 42% adjusted EBITDA margins. Subscription revenues surged 18% year-over-year, while customer retention remained a priority with trailing 12-month maintenance renewal rates reaching 88%. For 2022, the company anticipates a 2-4% increase in total revenue, driven by growth in both license and subscription revenue. However, this growth may be partially offset by a decline in maintenance revenue. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to remain steady at 41%, with investments in Secure by Design initiatives, subscription transition, and sales and marketing factoring in. The company also expects an improvement in unlevered free cash flow conversion over 2021 levels.
