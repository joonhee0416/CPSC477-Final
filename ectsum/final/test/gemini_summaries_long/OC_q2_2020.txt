Owens Corning delivered solid Q2 financials despite the challenges of COVID-19. The company reported revenues of $1.6 billion and adjusted EBIT of $167 million. A faster-than-anticipated recovery in residential end markets, particularly in the U.S., contributed to the results. In Insulation, North American residential fiberglass demand remained strong due to the U.S. new construction housing recovery. Composites experienced slower recovery and management continues to balance production with demand. Roofing volumes closely tracked the market, with a decline driven by destocking and reduced out-the-door demand early in the quarter. Strong cost controls helped maintain margins and cash flow across the company. Owens Corning also proactively managed expenses, capital investments, and liquidity, reducing operating expenses, capital additions, and paying down debt to $1.5 billion. Looking ahead, the company expects sequentially higher revenues and earnings in Q3, driven by continued residential recovery and a slower pace of commercial and industrial recovery. Incremental margins are projected to be approximately 50% higher in Insulation, slightly better in Roofing, and in a similar range to Q2 in Composites. The company remains committed to managing expenses, capital investments, and returning cash to shareholders while prioritizing deleveraging the balance sheet and maintaining its dividend.
