Booz Allen Hamilton Holdings reported a solid second quarter with revenue growth of 4.3% year-over-year driven by inorganic contributions, solid operational performance, and investments in strategic acquisitions such as Liberty and Tracepoint. The company outperformed in bottom-line metrics, with strong profit margins contributing to adjusted EBITDA growth of 18.1% and adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 22%. Despite some headwinds from comps and a slow ramp-up on contracts, Booz Allen remains confident in its ability to accelerate growth due to its large backlog, strong bookings, and increased hiring. The company continues to execute on its Velocity, Leadership, and Technology (VLT) strategy, focusing on capturing key market opportunities, capitalizing on acquisitions, and investing in its people and solutions to drive growth beyond this fiscal year. Booz Allen reaffirmed its fiscal year 2022 guidance, expecting revenue growth between 7% and 10%, adjusted EBITDA margin in the mid-10% range, and adjusted diluted earnings per share between $4.10 and $4.30.
