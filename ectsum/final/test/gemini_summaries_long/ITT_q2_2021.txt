ITT's recent earnings call highlighted strong organic growth across all segments, totaling 47%. Revenue increased 34% to $692 million, with segment operating income up 206% to $114 million, contributing to an adjusted earnings per share of $0.94. Despite divestiture losses and increased expenses, adjusted EPS grew 65%. The company attributed growth to outperforming global auto production in Friction and strong sales in Industrial Process and Connect and Control Technologies. ITT divested a subsidiary holding asbestos liabilities, eliminating future responsibility and generating stronger cash flow. Operational excellence drove margin expansion at the segment level, despite commodity inflation. While supply chain disruptions and raw material inflation pose challenges, ITT raised its outlook for 2021. Organic revenue growth is now projected at 8-10%, with adjusted earnings per share between $3.90 and $4.05, eclipsing pre-COVID levels and positioning the company for long-term success.
