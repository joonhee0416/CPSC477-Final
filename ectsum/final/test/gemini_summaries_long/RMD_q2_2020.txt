ResMed's strong Q2 performance was driven by double-digit revenue growth (14% constant currency), indicating market share gains in both its sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses. Device growth was 8% globally, while masks and accessories growth was an impressive 16% constant currency, highlighting ResMed's innovative product portfolio. The company's software-as-a-service (SaaS) business also saw strong growth of 37% year-over-year, primarily due to the MatrixCare acquisition. ResMed continues to invest in R&D, with a particular focus on digital health solutions and machine learning capabilities, aiming to leverage over 5.5 billion nights of respiratory medical data in the cloud for actionable insights. The company is also collaborating with healthcare systems to improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. ResMed has a solid pipeline of new products and digital health solutions in sleep apnea, COPD, and out-of-hospital software, which provides confidence for continued growth.
