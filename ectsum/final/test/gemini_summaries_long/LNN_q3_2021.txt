Total revenue surged by 32% to $161.9 million in Q3, with the Irrigation segment leading the growth. Irrigation revenues increased by 47%, primarily driven by higher sales volumes and pricing in North America (up 39%) and international markets (up 62%). Despite rising costs, operating margin for the Irrigation segment improved to 17.1%. In contrast, the Infrastructure segment experienced a 21% revenue decline, primarily due to fewer Road Zipper sales. The segment's operating margin dropped to 17.3%. Overall, the company reported earnings per share of $1.61, exceeding analyst expectations of $1.46 per share. However, management anticipates ongoing inflation and supply chain challenges to impact the remainder of the fiscal year, while expressing optimism about the long-term outlook for the Infrastructure business.
