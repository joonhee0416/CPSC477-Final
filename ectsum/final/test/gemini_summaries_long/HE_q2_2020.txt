Hawaiian Electric Industries (HEI) reported second-quarter earnings per share of $0.45, exceeding last year's $0.39. The utility segment benefited from operational efficiencies and expense management, with revenue increases from RAM and project recoveries. The bank's performance was influenced by mortgage production and securities gains, offsetting tighter lending margins and higher provisions. Despite a decline in sales, the utility's decoupled regulatory structure stabilized revenues. The PUC approved a non-rate increase settlement for Oahu and a Maui rate case deferral. HEI plans cost reductions by year-end 2022 to maintain $25 million in annual savings. The company continues to advance renewable energy projects, including solar and storage additions, to reach 100% renewable energy. The bank remains focused on risk management and has secured significant PPP loans. Despite lower net interest margins due to federal stimulus, ample liquidity, and a healthy loan portfolio, HEI has provided a pre-tax pre-provision income guidance range of $90-$110 million, with earnings asset growth in the mid-single digits. Consolidated EPS guidance remains unavailable due to uncertainty in bank provision.
