In the fourth quarter, First Bancorp reported net income of $50 million ($0.23 per share), driven by loan growth and lower funding costs. Loan originations reached $1.4 billion, primarily in commercial and auto portfolios, while deposits grew by $257 million. The company's net interest income increased by $29 million, partially offset by a reduction in residential mortgages. Non-interest income also rose by $5 million due to higher service charges on deposits and gains on loan sales. Expenses increased by $28 million, mainly due to the integration of Santander operations and pandemic-related costs. Credit-related expenses declined slightly, but the provision for credit losses increased to $22.3 million, primarily due to a deterioration in the commercial real estate outlook. Asset quality remained stable, with non-performing loans increasing slightly but still below pre-pandemic levels. The company's capital ratios remained strong, with CET1 at 17.3%. Looking ahead, First Bancorp anticipates noise related to the integration in the first half of 2021, with a focus on completing the process by summer. The company expects revenue growth and variable expenses to increase in the second half as the economy recovers. The company also announced an increase in its quarterly cash dividend to $0.07 per share.
