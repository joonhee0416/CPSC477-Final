Despite a mixed first quarter with net income and FFO meeting estimates, the company experienced variations in portfolio operating income due to reduced parking revenue and lower residential results. Termination and other income fell below expectations, while land gain and tax provision exceeded forecasts. G&A expense decreased, and FFO contributions from unconsolidated joint ventures were slightly lower. The portfolio and operations remain stable, with minimal deferrals and excellent collections. For the second quarter, portfolio operating income is expected to remain flat, while G&A expense will increase. The company's capital plan remains unchanged, with a focus on revenue maintenance, capital creation, and dividend growth. Notably, safety and health concerns are becoming a priority for tenants, driving demand for trophy-level inventory. The company's robust growth drivers include approved mixed-use master plans, life science development, and a favorable investment environment.
