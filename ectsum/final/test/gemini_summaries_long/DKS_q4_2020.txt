DICK's Sporting Goods achieved strong financial results for 2020, despite store closures, with record sales and earnings. Consolidated same-store sales increased 9.9% for the year, fueled by favorable consumer demand across outdoor activities, home fitness, and active lifestyles. eCommerce sales surged 100% to $2.8 billion, representing 30% of total sales. For the fourth quarter, sales rose 19.8% to $3.13 billion, with a 19.3% increase in same-store sales. Gross margin expanded significantly due to fewer promotions and clearance activity, driving a 66% year-over-year increase in non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to $6.12. Looking ahead to 2021, DICK's expects same-store sales to be in the range of -2% to +2%, with a low double-digit increase compared to 2019. Non-GAAP EBT is projected to be between $550 million and $650 million, up 36% from 2019 but down 18% from 2020. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $4.40 to $5.20, representing a 30% increase compared to 2019 but a 22% decrease compared to 2020. The company plans to invest in its existing stores, technology, open new locations, and return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
