Weyerhaeuser set a record with $1.6 billion in adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter, a 43% increase. Despite recent declines in benchmark pricing, the company anticipates demand to remain strong in the following quarter, particularly in new residential construction. In the Timberlands segment, which contributed to the record-breaking performance, third quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA are expected to be lower, with slightly reduced domestic log sales realizations and higher forestry and road costs, although export markets are expected to remain favorable. In Real Estate, Energy, and Natural Resources, adjusted EBITDA is projected to be comparable to the third quarter of 2020, with continued strong demand for HBU properties and increased guidance for full-year 2021 adjusted EBITDA to $290 million. The Wood Products segment is expected to experience a significant decline in adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter due to reduced benchmark pricing for lumber and OSB, but higher sales volumes are anticipated as inventories normalize and demand for do-it-yourself activity improves. Overall, Weyerhaeuser maintains a favorable outlook, supported by encouraging long-term housing demand fundamentals and a strong balance sheet.
