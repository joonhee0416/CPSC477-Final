In Q1 of 2021, the company experienced a strong 21% increase in net sales to $116 million, driven by increased sales in herbicides for various crops and pest strips. International sales also contributed to the growth, particularly due to the newly acquired businesses in Australia and India. Despite operating expenses rising by 13%, the company exercised financial discipline, resulting in a reduction as a percentage of sales. Operating income doubled, and net income increased six-fold, reaching $3.1 million. The company's biological businesses, which offer soil health solutions, continue to show promising growth, generating over $30 million in annual sales. The company's SIMPAS, Ultimus technology provides a unique solution for the carbon credit market, offering precise application and monitoring of crop inputs, including biologicals that enhance soil health. The company remains optimistic about the upcoming year, anticipating low-double-digit growth in net sales, further fueled by strong commodity prices in row crops. The company expects net income growth to outpace sales growth.
