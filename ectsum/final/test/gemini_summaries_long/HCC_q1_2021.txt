Despite the ongoing impact of COVID-19 and the Chinese ban on Australian coal, Warrior Met Coal reported positive free cash flow for the fourth consecutive quarter. Sales volume increased to 2 million short tons, with strong demand and higher steel prices. The company's gross price realization was 95% of the Platts premium lowball fob Australian index price, primarily due to increased sales to Chinese customers. However, adjusted EBITDA decreased due to a 13% drop in average net selling prices. The company's cash cost per short ton was its second lowest in four years, and it maintains a strong balance sheet with no near-term debt maturities. Warrior Met Coal is currently facing a strike by the United Mine Workers of America, which may disrupt production and shipment activities. The company has contingency plans in place but expects the strike to cause some disruption. Due to ongoing uncertainty, Warrior Met Coal is not providing full-year guidance at this time.
