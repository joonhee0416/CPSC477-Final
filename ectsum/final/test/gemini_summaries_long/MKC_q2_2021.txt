McCormick & Co. reported strong second-quarter results driven by consumer trends and acquisitions. Total sales increased by 11%, marking a double-digit increase in two-year sales growth rates. Despite higher COVID-19 and inflation costs, the company's adjusted operating income increased by 4%. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.69, driven by a higher tax rate. The company increased its 2021 outlook, now projecting sales growth of 11-13%, adjusted operating income growth of 8-10%, and adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.00 to $3.05, excluding special charges.

Consumer segment sales declined by 2% due to the company lapping high demand in the prior year. However, on a two-year basis, sales grew by double-digits. The company's U.S. branded portfolio consumption increased by 18%, driven by increased home cooking. Supply constraints impacted shelf conditions, but the company is refilling the inventory pipeline and expects to regain share. In EMEA, the company maintained or gained share with Schwartz, Ducros, and Frank's RedHot. Growth in the Asia Pacific region recovered from last year's lockdown.

Flavor Solutions sales surged by 39%, driven by recovery from pandemic-driven shutdowns and increased demand from foodservice customers. The company is gaining momentum with new products and has won business in the beverage and snack seasonings categories. Acquisitions of FONA and Cholula have significantly contributed to growth, with FONA driving growth in the beverages category.

The company highlighted long-term consumer trends that support continued growth, including increased interest in healthy cooking, home cooking, and flavor experimentation. The company is making investments to increase capacity and meet growing demand.

Overall, McCormick remains confident in its growth trajectory and is well-positioned to continue delivering differentiated growth in the future.
