Synchrony Financial achieved strong Q2 results, reflecting its robust model and partner-centric approach. Net earnings reached a record $1.2B, driven by a 35% increase in purchase volume and a 25-basis-point increase in net interest margin. Despite persistently elevated payment rates, loan receivables grew slightly to $78.4B. Credit performance remains strong, with a decline in net charge-offs to 3.57%. The company returned $521M to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Synchrony's go-to-market strategy emphasizes scalable and innovative solutions to meet customer needs. The Home & Auto platform is well-positioned to capitalize on consumer interest in home improvement and upgrade, leveraging data and analytics to drive acquisition and repeat sales. The company anticipates a gradual moderation in payment rates, leading to increasing net interest margin in the second half of the year. Despite industrywide forbearance expiration, Synchrony remains optimistic about credit quality and expects delinquencies to begin rising in late 2021, potentially peaking in mid-2022. Synchrony has a strong capital position with a CET1 ratio of 17.8% under the CECL transition rules. The company continues to invest in digital innovation and is confident in its ability to drive strong financial results and shareholder value.
