Despite the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, American Assets Trust's financial results are expected to improve in 2021. The company's diversified portfolio, strong balance sheet, and ample liquidity have enabled it to weather the storm, and it is now on the path to recovery. Collections have continued to improve, with a collection rate of over 93% in Q1 and an expectation of further improvement in the coming months. The company's office portfolio has remained resilient, with a 94% occupancy rate and a focus on preserving pre-COVID rental rates, resulting in a weighted average increase of 8.9% over prior rents on new and renewal leases. The company is also investing in its current portfolio through renovation and redevelopment, with projects underway in San Francisco, Portland, and San Diego. The company's Board of Directors has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share for the first quarter and is considering an increase in the dividend once the mandatory quarantine in Waikiki is eliminated.
