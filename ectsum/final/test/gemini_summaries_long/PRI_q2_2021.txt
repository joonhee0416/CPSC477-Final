Primerica's strong Q2 performance was driven by growth in both its term life and investment segments. Adjusted operating revenues surged 25% to $654 million, while diluted adjusted operating income per share rose 33% to $3.25. The term life segment saw a 17% revenue increase and a 23% increase in pre-tax operating income. Persistency improved across all durations, resulting in a 16% increase in adjusted direct premiums year-over-year. The investment and savings segment exceeded $3 billion in sales for the first time, with strong equity markets contributing to investor confidence. Net inflows of $1.2 billion were double the level in the prior year period. While consumer sentiment for life insurance remains strong, normalizing trends may result in a 5% decline in life sales for the full year compared to last year's elevated levels. The acquisition of e-TeleQuote will expand Primerica's offerings with senior health solutions. The company estimates a $6 million impact from COVID-related claims in the third quarter and anticipates third quarter investment sales growth in the 30-40% range.
