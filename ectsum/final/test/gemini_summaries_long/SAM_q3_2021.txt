The Boston Beer Company experienced slower-than-anticipated hard seltzer growth, resulting in unanticipated costs of $133 million or $7.73 per diluted share. Despite this setback, the company remains confident in its long-term growth potential and plans to continue investing in brand building and innovation. The Truly hard seltzer brand has gained significant market share while the Twisted Tea and Sam Adams brands have also experienced growth. Boston Beer is targeting depletions and shipment growth in the mid-single digits to low double digits for 2022 and projects an increase in revenue per barrel of 3% to 6%. The company's long-term growth strategy involves building on its portfolio of strong brands, including its number one hard tea (Twisted Tea), number one hard cider (Angry Orchard), and the number two hard seltzer (Truly). Despite the challenges faced in 2021, Boston Beer believes it is well-positioned for future growth.
