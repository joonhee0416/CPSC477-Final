Driven by robust demand for SmartSide products, LP experienced exceptional first-quarter results. SmartSide net sales surged by nearly 50% to $283 million, with EBITDA more than doubling to $90 million, due in part to increased sales of innovative pre-finished products. OSB prices also remained high, contributing to remarkable cash flow in the OSB segment. Furthermore, LP exceeded $1 billion in sales and generated record quarterly EBITDA of $461 million and operating cash flow of $314 million, resulting in an impressive $3.01 per share in earnings. Looking ahead, LP is accelerating its SmartSide capacity expansion plan, with the Houlton conversion project on schedule to begin production in late Q1 2022. Despite supply chain challenges, including the recent shortage of vital adhesive, the company remains optimistic due to strong housing and repair markets, which are fueling high demand for both SmartSide and OSB. To further support growth, LP has authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program and declared a dividend of $0.16 per share, payable on June 1st.
