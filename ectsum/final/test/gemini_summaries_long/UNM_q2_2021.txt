Unum Group reported a solid second quarter, with a 13% year-over-year increase in after-tax adjusted operating income to $1.39 per share, driven by a decline in COVID-related mortality and strong investment performance. The company revised its outlook for 2021, expecting a decline of approximately 1% to 3% in after-tax adjusted operating income per share, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19. However, underlying performance is expected to remain strong, with positive growth in premium income and solid earnings in core business segments. The company's investment portfolio continues to perform well, with strong returns from alternative investments and a successful 30-year debt offering. Unum's capital position remains robust, with risk-based capital ratios well above target levels. While the Delta variant poses some uncertainty, the company remains optimistic about its long-term prospects, with a focus on investing in growth and returning capital to shareholders.
