EnPro delivered exceptional results in Q2, with sales surging 20.9% YoY to $298.6 million, driven by organic growth and the acquisition of Alluxa. Adjusted EBITDA rose 52.5% to $57.2 million, expanding the margin by 400 basis points to 19.2%. Strong demand in various end markets, including heavy-duty trucks, general industrial, and semiconductors, contributed to the growth. Despite rising raw material costs, the company's strategy of portfolio reshaping, operating leverage, and pricing adjustments led to improved profitability. EnPro increased its 2021 guidance, projecting adjusted EBITDA of $200-210 million and adjusted diluted EPS of $5.16-5.50. The company's solid financial foundation, experienced leadership, and diverse workforce position it for continued growth and enhanced shareholder value.
