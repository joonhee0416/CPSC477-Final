Kilroy Realty's third-quarter performance was marked by strong leasing activity, with over 600,000 square feet signed, including key transactions in San Diego and Seattle. The stabilized portfolio saw a notable increase in GAAP rents (26%) and cash rents (14%). The company continues to allocate capital to its life science platform, with three major pre-leases totaling 330,000 square feet in San Diego's most sought-after submarkets. Kilroy also announced the expansion of their Oyster Point life science campus in South San Francisco, adding 2.5 million square feet of state-of-the-art facilities to their portfolio. In-process development projects remain a high priority, with $2.6 billion on track for completion over the next two years, targeting 170 million in incremental cash NOI when stabilized. Same-store cash NOI increased by 16.6% year-over-year, reflecting strong rent growth. The stabilized portfolio maintained high occupancy levels at 91.5%. Kilroy's 2021 FFO per share guidance is projected to range between $3.74 to $3.80, with the midpoint unchanged despite debt redemption costs.
