Despite the impact of COVID-19, the company reported a net income of $14.3 million ($0.22 per share) in Q2. The net interest margin decreased 23 basis points due to lower rates, higher cash balances, and the impact of PPP loans. However, the company benefited from lower deposit costs and noninterest-bearing deposit growth. Credit quality saw an improvement, with a net recovery of bad debt and an increase in the allowance for credit losses to 1.11%. The company implemented measures such as interest rate floors on commercial loans and placing focus on non-interest bearing deposits to manage the impact of low interest rates. The loan pipeline remains robust, and residential mortgage originations have increased significantly. The company also incurred expenses related to COVID-19 response and the pending acquisition of SB One, which is expected to close the following day. The company remains confident in its capital structure and balance sheet strength, and has approved a $0.23 cash dividend per share.
