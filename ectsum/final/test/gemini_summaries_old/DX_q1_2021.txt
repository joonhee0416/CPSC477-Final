Dynex experienced a successful first quarter, generating a 7.2% total economic return and a 15% growth in total shareholders' capital. Through active portfolio management and capital allocation, the company has achieved a 34.8% total economic return over the past four quarters. Dynex's performance is attributed to optimizing its balance sheet, executing an accretive capital investment strategy, and forecasting accurate market trends. The rise in rates during the quarter was offset by gains in hedging strategies, resulting in a book value increase of 5.2%. Moving forward, Dynex remains optimistic, anticipating a range-bound environment and opportunities to add assets at low double-digit returns. The company's focus on flexibility, nimbleness, and ample leverage capacity positions it to deliver consistent returns and maintain industry leadership, supported by its commitment to integrity, community, and a diverse organization.
