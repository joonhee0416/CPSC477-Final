Korn Ferry recorded a record-breaking quarter, with revenue soaring 47% to $639 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share reaching $1.53. This financial success was driven by robust demand for their talent management solutions amidst ongoing workplace transitions and digitalization. The company plans to capitalize on these secular changes by focusing on innovation, replication, and scaling.

Growth was evident across all business lines, with Executive Search contributing 59% growth year-over-year, and RPO and Professional Search experiencing a 76% increase. Consulting and Digital also saw double-digit growth. To enhance their offerings, Korn Ferry acquired the Lucas Group during the quarter.

The company's strategy involves driving a top-down go-to-market approach to foster lasting partnerships, increasing cross-referrals within the firm, and monetizing their intellectual property through subscription offerings. They will also invest in learning development outsourcing and maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy, including strategic acquisitions.

Korn Ferry remains optimistic about future growth, with strong new business momentum and a record high backlog. The company anticipates revenue between $640 million and $660 million in Q3 of fiscal year 2022, with adjusted diluted earnings per share ranging from $1.42 to $1.58 and GAAP diluted earnings per share between $1.38 and $1.56.
