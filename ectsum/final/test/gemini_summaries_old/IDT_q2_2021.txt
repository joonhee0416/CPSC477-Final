IDT reported robust financial results for the quarter, driven by significant revenue expansion in three higher-margin segments: National Retail Solutions (NRS), BOSS Revolution Money Transfer, and net2phone-UCaaS. NRS saw exceptional growth in POS terminal network expansion, with revenue soaring by over 150% year-over-year. BOSS Revolution Money Transfer revenue climbed by 73% as the company expanded its disbursement network to Southern Asia and plans to launch the service in Canada and the U.K. in fiscal 2022. net2phone-UCaaS subscription revenue surged by 36% due to geographic expansion and enhanced feature integration with leading CRM and communication platforms. Despite a decline in carrier services revenues, aggregate adjusted EBITDA less capex in the traditional communications segment increased significantly. IDT is preparing to relaunch its BOSS Revolution mobile initiative and emphasizes the importance of entrepreneurship as a driver of value creation.
