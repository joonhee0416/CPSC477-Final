Brink's reported strong third-quarter results, exceeding guidance and analyst expectations. Revenue grew 11% organically at 6%, although slower than anticipated. Despite labor shortages and wage inflation in the US, operating profit grew 16% with a 50 basis point margin increase to 10.8%. The company reaffirmed its full-year guidance, including revenue between $4.1 and $4.2 billion, operating profit of approximately $465 million, and adjusted EBITDA of $660 million. Furthermore, Brink's affirmed its preliminary 2022 adjusted EBIT target range of $785 to $825 million. The company expects continued revenue growth in 2022 driven by organic growth, price increases, and the initial contributions from its digital solutions, anticipating revenue to exceed 100% of pre-COVID levels. To enhance shareholder value, Brink's announced a $150 million ASR expected to be completed by November and authorized an additional $250 million over the next two years. The company highlighted its strong position and growth opportunities in the cash payments market, and its strategic plan to expand its presence with digital solutions. Brink's will host an Investor Day on December 15 to provide further insights into its future strategy.
