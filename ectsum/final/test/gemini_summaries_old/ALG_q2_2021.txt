Alamo Group reported a strong second quarter with a significant increase in sales and earnings compared to the prior year's COVID-impacted quarter. Total net sales reached $348 million, a 29% increase, driven by strong demand across both the Industrial and Agricultural divisions. Industrial division sales rose by 27%, while Agricultural division sales surged by 35%. Notably, the company's backlog increased by 10% during the quarter and now stands at $503.6 million, a 132% increase over the prior year's quarter. However, the company continues to face challenges, including supply chain disruptions, labor capacity issues, and rising raw material costs. Despite these challenges, adjusted net income increased by 73% to $23.4 million, and EBITDA rose by 30% to $44.9 million. Alamo Group also reduced its total outstanding debt by $38.7 million during the quarter and strengthened its balance sheet, positioning the company well for potential acquisition opportunities. While cost pressures and component shortages are expected to continue through the rest of the year, Alamo Group remains confident in its ability to navigate these challenges and deliver solid results.
