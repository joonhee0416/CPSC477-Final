Duke Realty's earnings call revealed continued strength in the industrial real estate sector, with demand reaching near-record levels. The company signed 9.5 million square feet of leases during the quarter, resulting in a 22% increase in cash rent growth within its portfolio. The development pipeline remains robust, with $349 million in new projects started, and the company raised its full-year guidance for core FFO growth to 13.8% and AFFO per share growth to 11.6%. Additionally, the dividend was raised by almost 10%. Cap rate compression and rent growth continue to outpace material cost increases, leading to improved margins. The company remains optimistic about the balance of the year and projects continued strong growth in the logistics sector, with an expectation of maintaining high occupancy rates and rent growth while driving substantial profit margins from its development pipeline.
