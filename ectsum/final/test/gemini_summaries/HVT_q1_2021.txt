Havertys reported strong Q1 results, driven by a surge in demand for home furnishings. Delivered sales increased by 31.8%, while written sales jumped by 54.5%. The company attributed this growth to increased traffic, higher closing rates, and average ticket prices. Despite supply chain headwinds, Havertys received 10% more product in Q1 compared to Q4 and expects similar flow in Q2. Gross profit margin expanded by 160 basis points to 57.1%, driven by improved merchandising, pricing, and mix. SG&A expenses increased by 12.5% due to higher sales activity, but declined as a percentage of sales by 800 basis points. Net income surged to $19.4 million, resulting in diluted EPS of $1.04 per share. The company plans to invest in inventory and distribution capacities, and expects gross margins for 2021 to be between 56.5% and 57%.
