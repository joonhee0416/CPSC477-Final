Prologis, a leader in the logistics real estate industry, reported strong financial performance and key operational metrics in the fourth quarter and full year 2021. Core FFO per share grew 14% year-over-year to $4.15 for the full year, driven by strong cash same-store NOI growth and rent growth above initial forecasts. Average occupancy remained high at 97.4%. The company's strategic capital business continued to drive growth, with $4.4 billion of third-party equity raised during the year and record development starts of $3.6 billion. Market dynamics remain favorable, with demand for logistics space exceeding supply, resulting in record rent and value growth. Looking ahead to 2022, Prologis expects core FFO, including net promote income, to grow by 22%, excluding promotes, by 10%. The company's long-term growth runway is supported by a pipeline of $26 billion in future development opportunities, underpinned by its low cost of capital and unmatched scale.
