Teledyne experienced a strong first quarter, surpassing historical records with the highest sales, earnings, operating margin, and cash flow. Excluding non-recurring expenses related to the pending FLIR acquisition, earnings increased 39.2%. Sales growth was observed across most business categories except for commercial aerospace, which now accounts for only 4% of total sales. The company received a record number of orders, resulting in a backlog of $1.8 billion. Organic sales growth is forecasted at 6% for 2021. Teledyne continues to be enthusiastic about the FLIR acquisition, anticipating significant synergies and earnings per share accretion even on a GAAP basis in 2022. In the first quarter, the Instrumentation segment saw a 291 bps increase in operating margin, Digital Imaging saw a 200 bps increase, Aerospace and Defense Electronics saw a significant increase of over 1,000 bps, and Engineered Systems saw a 242 bps increase. Notably, cash flow from operations increased by approximately 64%, while free cash flow nearly doubled. The company expects second-quarter earnings per share between $2.85 and $2.95 and full-year earnings per share between $12.00 and $12.20, both excluding the impact of the FLIR acquisition.
