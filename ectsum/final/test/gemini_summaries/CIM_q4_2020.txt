Chimera's Q4 performance highlighted a 4% book value improvement, resulting in a 6% economic return. The company's mortgage portfolio continues to excel, with strong underlying housing fundamentals and a well-seasoned loan portfolio. Securitization remains a key financing strategy, with Chimera successfully issuing 11 deals in 2020, strengthening its liquidity and cash position. As the housing market booms, Chimera is well-positioned with low leverage, allowing for future asset growth or equity repurchases. Financial highlights for Q4 include a core earnings per share of $0.29 and an economic net interest return on equity of 12.5%. Despite a slight increase in expenses, Chimera remains committed to delivering a strong risk-adjusted dividend to shareholders.
