Standex reported solid financial results in Q1 driven by strong organic growth, particularly in Electronics (37%) and Scientific (29%) segments. Adjusted consolidated operating margin expanded significantly to 13.4%, marking the second consecutive quarter of record margins. The Electronics segment benefited from high demand for relays in renewable energy, EVs, and other end-markets, while the Scientific segment saw growth in retail pharmacies and clinical labs. Standex continues to execute on its productivity initiatives and pursue growth opportunities, with an active pipeline of $61 million in revenue expected to deliver $19 million in first-year sales. Despite a slight decrease in Q2 Electronics revenue, the company expects a solid start to the year with stronger financial performance year-over-year, supported by end-market trends and ongoing productivity initiatives. The company has a strong balance sheet with $267 million in liquidity and expects to repatriate $35 million in cash during FY22. Standex remains opportunistic in allocating capital for both organic and inorganic growth opportunities.
