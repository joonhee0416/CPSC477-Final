This quarter's operating earnings exceeded expectations despite muted product demand, driven by strong performance in nonbanking businesses, mortgage banking, deposit growth, and the Steuben acquisition. Despite this, credit demand declined, resulting in a 1% decrease in the total loan book. The company's total assets and average interest-earning assets increased significantly due to the Steuben acquisition and government stimulus-related funding. Delinquent and nonperforming loans are anticipated to rise due to the economic impact of COVID-19. However, the company's diversified revenue streams, including 38% from noninterest sources, are expected to mitigate the impact of declining net interest margins. Earnings improvement initiatives are being implemented, and the company expects to continue paying a quarterly dividend.
