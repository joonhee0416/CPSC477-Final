In Q1, the company posted a record $669 million in sales, a 32% increase over the prior year, driven equally by favorable pricing and volume growth. International sales surged 82%, and the backlog and order pace remain robust. Adjusted EBITDA increased 4% despite inflationary cost pressures on materials, labor, and transportation. The company has implemented price increases to cover these costs and is working on mitigating programs to offset headwinds. Material prices have risen significantly, with the largest gap between historical highs and lows expected in Q2. However, material availability has improved. To address labor issues, the company is simplifying manufacturing processes and consolidating inventory. SG&A expenses included pandemic-related expenses not incurred in the prior year. Free cash flow decreased due to increased capital spending and working capital. The company updated its FY2022 guidance, expecting net sales of $2.5-$2.6 billion (26%-31% growth) and adjusted EBITDA of $635-$665 million (12%-17% growth).
