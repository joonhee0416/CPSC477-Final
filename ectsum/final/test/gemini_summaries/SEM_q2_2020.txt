Select Medical Holdings reported a 9.4% decline in quarterly revenue to $1.23 billion, primarily due to the pandemic's impact on outpatient and Concentra segments. However, critical illness recovery and rehabilitation hospital segments experienced growth. Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 4% to $178.8 million due to volume shortfalls in outpatient rehabilitation and Concentra segments, but was partially offset by revenue growth in the critical illness recovery segment. Adjusted earnings per share rose by 18% to $0.39. The company noted the receipt of $55 million in provider relief funds and an effective tax rate of 25.7%. Despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, Select Medical maintained a strong financial position with over $1 billion in available liquidity.
