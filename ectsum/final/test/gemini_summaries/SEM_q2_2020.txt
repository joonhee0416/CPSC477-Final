Select Medical Holdings experienced a 9.4% decline in net revenue for Q2 due to challenges in outpatient and Concentra segments. However, growth in critical illness recovery and rehabilitation hospital segments mitigated some losses. Critical illness recovery hospitals saw a 12.7% revenue increase, with occupancy rates rising to 72% from the previous year. Rehabilitation hospitals also performed well, with revenue increasing 5.2%. Labor costs drove up operating expenses to $1.12 billion, resulting in an adjusted EBITDA margin of 14.5%. Despite decreases in interest expense and a non-operating gain, net income fell, resulting in diluted EPS of $0.39. The company's liquidity remains strong at over $1 billion, including cash on hand and revolver availability.
