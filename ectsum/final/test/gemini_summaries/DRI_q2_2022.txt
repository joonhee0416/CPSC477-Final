Despite inflationary pressures, Darden's second-quarter performance remained strong, driven by sales growth across all brands and effective cost management. The company achieved restaurant-level EBITDA margin growth of 230 basis points compared to pre-COVID levels. Food and beverage expenses were higher due to elevated commodity inflation, while labor expenses were favorable due to sales leverage and operational efficiencies. For fiscal 2022, Darden projects total sales growth of 9-11%, same-restaurant sales growth of 29-31%, and EBITDA margin growth similar to previous estimates despite inflation of approximately 5.5%. The company expects to open 35-40 new restaurants and invest $425 million in capital spending. Additionally, effective May 30th, Rick Cardinas will take over as CEO, succeeding Gene Lee, who will continue as Chairman.
