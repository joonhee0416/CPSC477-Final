National Fuel reported a strong first quarter with a 5% increase in operating results, driven by growth in Seneca and NFG Midstream. Seneca remains focused on optimizing its development program and lowering unit costs. Despite pricing curtailments, production increased by 36% year-over-year, primarily due to the acquisition in Tioga County. Seneca added a second drilling rig to fill Leidy South capacity. The company projects $115 million to $125 million in free cash flow from its upstream and gathering businesses in 2021. National Fuel's FERC-regulated pipelines had a strong quarter, with earnings up nearly 25%, driven by the Supply Corporation rate case settlement and the new Empire North expansion project. FM100 expansion is on track to continue momentum in 2022 and 2023, potentially adding $50 million in annual revenue. While the Utility faced challenges due to warmer weather and pandemic impacts, revenues from New York's system modernization mechanism continue to grow. National Fuel emphasizes the role of natural gas in the energy complex, its cost and reliability advantages, and its commitment to reducing its emissions footprint.
