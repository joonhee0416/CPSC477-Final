ITW's strong Q2 performance demonstrated 43% revenue growth, including 37% organic growth, across all segments and geographies. Diluted earnings per share reached $2.45, reflecting a 143% increase, driven by operational execution and a one-time tax benefit. Despite supply chain challenges, ITW's customer-centric approach enabled it to maintain high service levels and capitalize on growth opportunities. For the full year, revenue guidance has been increased to $14.3-$14.6 billion, with organic growth estimated at 11%-13%. GAAP earnings per share guidance is now $8.55-$8.95, incorporating a non-recurring tax benefit. While raw material costs have risen, ITW's pricing initiatives aim to mitigate impact, with price/cost expected to be EPS-neutral for the year. Despite margin dilution due to increased costs, the company expects a record 24.5%-25.5% margin percentage, driven by volume leverage and enterprise initiatives. Free cash flow conversion is anticipated to remain near 100% of net income. ITW's strong demand and operational execution position it for continued success.
