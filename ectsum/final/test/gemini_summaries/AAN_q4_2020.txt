Aaron's reported a successful 2020 despite challenges, with a 2.8% decline in revenues to $1.735 billion due to store closures and a 26.4% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $208.9 million. The fourth quarter saw a 1% revenue decline to $430 million but a 4.8% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $53.7 million, driven by reduced inventory write-offs and improved customer payment activity. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased by 70 basis points to 12.5%, primarily due to lower write-offs. The company ended the year with a healthy lease portfolio, a cash balance of $76.1 million, and over $300 million in liquidity. Aaron's projects 2021 revenues of $1.65 billion to $1.7 billion and adjusted EBITDA between $155 million to $170 million, assuming gradual supply chain improvements and no significant economic deterioration. The company's strong balance sheet, cash flows, and operating leverage will enable it to perform well during this period of uncertainty.
