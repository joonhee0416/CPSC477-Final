In Q4 2019, the company reported earnings of $0.57 per share, exceeding the previous year's $0.23 per share. Factors contributing to this increase include a tax refund to customers, reduced O&M expenses, and favorable weather conditions. For the full year, earnings per share rose to $4.77 from $4.54 in 2018, driven by infrastructure growth and a 2% customer growth rate. Despite negative weather impacts and lower adjusted O&M expenses, the company expects continued cost savings of approximately $20 million in 2020. The company announced its goal to deliver 100% clean carbon-free electricity by 2050, including an accelerated exit from coal generation by 2031. Capital investments in clean energy resources are projected to increase, with potential upside seen beyond 2022. Customer affordability remains a priority, with projected rate increases aligning with inflation. The company's financial health, including a strong equity layer, will support low-cost capital and shareholder returns. Economic development in the service territory continues to drive growth, with high-profile data centers and manufacturing plants contributing to the region's strong employment and population growth. The company projects a weather-normalized consolidated earned return on average common equity of over 9.5% in 2020, maintaining its long-term rate base growth outlook of 6% to 7%.
