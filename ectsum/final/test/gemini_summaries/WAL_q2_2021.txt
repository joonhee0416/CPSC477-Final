Western Alliance reported record net revenues, PPNR, and EPS for Q2, buoyed by a $14.5 million credit loss provision reversal and strong balance sheet growth. Net interest income increased 16.8% to $370.5 million, driven by loan expansion and the addition of $4.5 billion in held-for-sale mortgages from the AmeriHome acquisition. Fee income hit a record $136 million, with $111.2 million from mortgage banking. AmeriHome, despite evolving mortgage fundamentals, met expectations and contributed $0.39 to EPS. Asset quality continued to improve, with total classified assets declining to 49 basis points of total assets, below pre-pandemic levels. Despite the acquisition of AmeriHome, Western Alliance maintained industry-leading returns on assets (1.86%) and tangible common equity (28.1%). While the bank expects some NIM pressure due to competition and loan mix shifts, it anticipates continued loan and deposit growth, rising PPNR, and a run rate of $9 EPS by year-end.
