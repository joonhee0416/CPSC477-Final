Despite ongoing COVID-19 challenges, CooperCos posted robust quarterly results with consolidated revenues of $681 million, driven by strong performances from both CooperVision and CooperSurgical. CooperVision saw success with its silicone hydrogel portfolio, especially MyDay and Biofinity, along with strength in torics and multifocals. The myopia management portfolio continued to flourish, with MiSight growing 82% and CooperSurgical posting a strong quarter with 16% growth in Paragard and 10% in fertility. CooperVision's silicone hydrogel dailies grew 8%, with MyDay and Clariti leading the way. Biofinity also performed well, driven by Biofinity Energys and Biofinity Toric Multifocal. In addition to ongoing product launches, CooperVision acquired SightGlass Vision and partnered with EssilorLuxottica to accelerate the commercialization of myopia management spectacles. CooperSurgical saw a strong performance in fertility, with growth across its product lines. Paragard continued its positive trajectory, growing 16% and benefiting from its hormone-free design. With a positive outlook due to increasing vaccination rates and favorable industry trends, CooperCos anticipates continued strong performance, targeting $12.90 to $13.10 non-GAAP earnings per share and approaching $500 million in free cash flow for fiscal 2021.
