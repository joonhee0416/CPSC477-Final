The company reported strong Q1 results with 24% revenue growth driven by consumer demand and cost-based pricing actions. Ongoing EBIT margin reached a record 12.4%, propelled by price mix expansion and net cost improvements, although offset by raw material inflation and other factors.

Despite these challenges, the company raised its full-year ongoing earnings per share guidance by 18% to $22.50-$23.50. Regional highlights include strong demand in North America, driving 20% revenue growth, and margin expansion in Europe, supported by pricing actions.

Capital allocation priorities include investments in R&D and capital expenditures, increased share buybacks, and returning cash to shareholders through dividend payments. The company's debt leverage target of 2 times has been achieved.
