National Retail Properties saw a strong finish to 2020, marked by increasing their common stock dividend for the 31st consecutive year, raising $700 million in debt capital, and reaching rent deferral agreements with tenants. Despite the pandemic, the company collected 95.7% of fourth quarter rent and 89.7% of annual rent for 2020. As of December 2020, their portfolio of over 3,100 properties maintained a 98.5% occupancy rate. The company's high lease renewal rate remained steady, with 80% of expiring leases being renewed by current tenants at close to 100% of the expiring rent and an average renewal term of six years. National Retail Properties has been pursuing rent receivables and ongoing rent payments with a strong approach, and their balance sheet remains strong with no amounts outstanding on its $900 million bank credit facility. The company believes that 2021 will bring sustained rent collection levels and improved tenant health, allowing them to take on a more offensive posture.
