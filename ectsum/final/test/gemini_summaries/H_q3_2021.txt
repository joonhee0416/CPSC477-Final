Hyatt experienced strong recovery momentum in Q3, reporting a doubling of adjusted EBITDA to $110 million. RevPAR significantly improved, reaching nearly 70% of pre-pandemic levels. Leisure transient demand continued to lead the recovery, with revenue exceeding 2019 levels in October. Despite challenges from the Delta variant, group and business transient demand showed steady progress, with group bookings for 2022 pacing well above pre-pandemic levels. The acquisition of Apple Leisure Group (ALG) doubled Hyatt's resort portfolio, increased its European footprint, and positioned it as the world's largest luxury all-inclusive resort operator. ALG's earnings exceed 2019 expectations, enabling Hyatt to accelerate its asset disposition strategy and reduce debt. By leveraging its asset-light growth and maintaining investment capacity, Hyatt aims to achieve an 80% fee-based earnings mix by 2024. Hyatt remains optimistic about the future, citing favorable forward bookings and anticipation of continued recovery in all segments.
