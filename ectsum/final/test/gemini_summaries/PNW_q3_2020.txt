Despite facing pandemic-related challenges and extreme heat, the company exceeded expectations, raising their 2020 consolidated earnings guidance from $4.75-$4.95 per share to $4.95-$5.15 per share. The record-breaking temperatures contributed significantly to this increase, offsetting expenses and reducing sales due to COVID-19. The company's fossil fleet availability factor remained high at 95.3%, while Palo Verde's capacity factor reached 100.2%. Customer engagement was exceptional, with significant energy conservation during peak hours on two days, reducing demand by 240MW. Effective planning mitigated wildfire risks, despite an active season. The company continues to invest in clean energy, executing a 200MW wind PPA and planning additional RFPs for outsourced and utility-owned energy storage. The issuance of $400 million in 30-year green bonds at a record-low rate of 2.65% demonstrates the company's financial strength. Prudent planning has accelerated O&M initiatives, with a revised guidance range of $870 million to $890 million, while lean initiatives aim to reduce 2020 O&M expenses by $20 million.
