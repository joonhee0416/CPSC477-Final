Despite the COVID-19 pandemic causing a significant impact on Hawaii's economy due to the suspension of tourism, Central Pacific Financial remains resilient with solid financial footing. The company's Q1 earnings per share stood at $0.29, with net income reaching $8.3 million. To navigate the economic challenges, Central Pacific has implemented cost-saving measures such as suspending share repurchases and reevaluating expenses. It has also taken comprehensive steps to support employees and customers during this crisis, including implementing remote work policies, providing personal protective equipment, and offering enhanced digital banking services. Despite the current challenges, the company remains optimistic about a potential return of visitors from Asia later this year and is committed to supporting local businesses and the community.
