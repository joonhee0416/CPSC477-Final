Curtiss-Wright reported a 12% sales increase in Q3, driven by growth in commercial aerospace, naval defense, and PacStar, which aligned with Army modernization priorities. Adjusted operating income also increased by 12% with margins remaining strong at 17.5%. Despite supply chain disruptions, the team's mitigation efforts limited their impact to sales timing rather than losses, thanks to a strong backlog. The company raised its full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance to $7.20-$7.35, reflecting growth of 9-12%. Operating margin guidance remains at 16.7-16.8%, despite a $12 million strategic R&D investment. Curtiss-Wright is confident in its long-term growth prospects, with a focus on disciplined capital allocation for acquisitions and shareholder value maximization.
