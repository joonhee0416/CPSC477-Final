Vishay reported a record quarterly revenue of $819 million in Q2 2021, a 7.1% increase quarter-over-quarter and a significant 40.8% surge compared to the same period last year. The company's adjusted earnings per share (EPS) were $0.61 for the quarter. Operating margin was 15.3%, with gross margin remaining steady at 28%. Variable costs were flat, while manufacturing cost reductions and volume-related efficiencies offset increased material and metal prices. Vishay experienced strong demand in all regions and across all end markets, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.38 and a record backlog of 7.5 months. The company is optimistic about Q3, guiding sales to a range of $810 million to $850 million, with a gross margin of 28.3%. Vishay is investing heavily in capacity expansion to meet the increasing demand and expects to generate solid free cash flow for the current year.
