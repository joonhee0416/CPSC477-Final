In Q1 2021, Hormel Foods achieved record sales of $2.5 billion, reflecting a 3% increase year-over-year. However, net earnings declined by 9% due to $15 million in incremental COVID-19 supply chain costs. Retail experienced particularly strong growth, with sales surging 13% thanks to strong performances from brands like SPAM, SKIPPY, Hormel chili, and Applegate. Deli channel sales also increased by 7%, led by Columbus branded products. Despite a 17% decline in foodservice due to pandemic impacts, Hormel Foods remains optimistic about a recovery in the industry.

Hormel Foods also announced its acquisition of the Planters business, a strategic move that will expand its snacking portfolio and increase its scale in key areas. The acquisition is expected to close soon, after which Hormel Foods will focus on giving Planters the attention and support it needs to grow.

Looking ahead, Hormel Foods is establishing fiscal 2021 guidance of $1.70 to $1.82 per share, excluding the impact of the Planters acquisition. The company anticipates ongoing retail momentum, a gradual recovery in foodservice, and continued improvements in its supply chain. Hormel Foods remains committed to investing in its leading brands and maintaining its long-term capital allocation strategy.
