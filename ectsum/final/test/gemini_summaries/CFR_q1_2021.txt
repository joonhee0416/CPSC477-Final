In Q1, Cullen/Frost reported robust financial results with earnings per share of $1.77, driven by solid deposit and loan growth. Despite economic challenges, loan demand remained strong, with average loans increasing by 18% year-over-year. Excluding PPP loans, average loans declined by just 1%, reflecting a modest impact from the pandemic. Deposits grew by 30%, highlighting the company's safe haven status during uncertain times. Asset quality improved, with a significant decline in problem assets and net charge-offs dropping to 4 basis points of average loans. Energy-related problem loans continued to decrease, and the company is actively rationalizing its exposure to this segment. Non-energy segments, including restaurants, hotels, and retail, showed stable or improving credit quality. The company's Houston expansion exceeded expectations, with strong organic growth in loans, deposits, and new business relationships. In addition, the company expanded its consumer banking offerings, launched a new $100 overdraft grace feature, and received recognition for its exceptional customer service. Despite margin pressure due to higher balances at the Fed, the company projects annual non-interest expense growth in the range of 3.5% to 4% and believes that current analyst estimates for 2021 earnings may be conservative based on the company's strong Q1 performance and improving credit metrics.
