Textron experienced a solid fourth quarter, with revenue of $3.3 billion and adjusted income from continuing operations of $0.94 per share. The company's aviation segment remained strong, with increased aircraft utilization, low preowned inventory levels, and backlog growth of $655 million. Defense revenues were lower as expected due to the wind down of the H-1 production program, while Textron Systems delivered another strong quarter with a full-year margin of 14.8%. Industrial revenues were down due to supply chain challenges. Overall, the company repurchased 4.5 million shares in the fourth quarter and expects full-year 2022 earnings per share between $3.80 and $4.00.
