Hecla Mining Company's earnings call highlighted a strong operational and financial performance in 2021, driven by increased silver demand and the implementation of the innovative UCB mining method at the Lucky Friday mine. The new mining method contributed to a 75% increase in Lucky Friday's silver production, and the mine is expected to produce 20% more in 2022. Furthermore, with increased production and byproduct credits, the all-in sustaining cost per ounce at Lucky Friday is projected to decline by over 30%. Greens Creek also had a robust year, generating free cash flow of $185 million. Casa Berardi achieved record throughput and increased reserves, with a reserve mine plan of 14 years. Overall, Hecla's low production costs, combined with high silver margins, resulted in strong free cash flow generation of $111 million in 2021 and the company anticipates continued growth in the coming years. Despite facing inflationary pressures, Hecla's unique operations and low exposure to rising energy costs mitigate these impacts. The company plans to invest in exploration and pre-development, including at Greens Creek, Casa, Nevada, and San Sebastian. Additionally, Hecla has taken steps to reassess its Montana assets, withdrawing the previous plan of operations and submitting a new one for the Montanore site to develop a modern mine plan.
