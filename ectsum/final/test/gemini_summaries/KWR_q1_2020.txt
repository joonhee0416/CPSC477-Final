Quaker Houghton's Q1 results showed resilience amid COVID-19 challenges. Pro forma sales declined 3% due to volume impacts from Boeing's 737 MAX production halt and COVID-19, but organic volume growth was 2%. Gross margins improved, reflecting integration-related procurement savings. Pro forma adjusted EBITDA rose 10% due to integration savings, the Norman Hay acquisition, and cost control measures. The company has increased its synergy achievement guidance, expecting $53 million in 2020 (up from $35 million) and a total of $75 million by 2022 (increased from $60 million). Despite April revenues being down 30%, Quaker Houghton expects a gradual recovery in the second half of the year. The company anticipates its 2020 adjusted EBITDA to exceed $200 million and remains optimistic about future growth through share gains and a rebound in demand.
