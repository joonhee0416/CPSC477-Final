Aptar Group reported strong performance in the first quarter, with a resilient business model leveraging its diverse end markets. Despite the ongoing pandemic, demand for their food and beverage dispensing closures soared due to at-home cooking trends. The pharma segment offset declines in non-critical healthcare with increased demand for injectable components and active material science solutions related to COVID-19 vaccines and test kits. Beauty and home sales varied, with personal care and home care segments showing growth while beauty declined due to pandemic-related closures. The company expects demand to remain similar in Q2, with easier comparisons in beauty due to the challenging prior-year quarter. Aptar's adjusted earnings per share for Q2 is projected to range from $0.91 to $0.99. Despite inflationary pressures, the company is investing in growth projects and maintaining a solid balance sheet with a leverage ratio of 1.4.
