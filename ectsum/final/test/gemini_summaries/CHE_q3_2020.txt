Chemed Corporation's Q3 earnings reflect ongoing recovery from pandemic disruptions. VITAS Healthcare saw sequential operational improvement in May, with Q3 admissions increasing 4.7%, though average daily census declined slightly due to suppressed referrals from nursing homes and assisted-living facilities. Roto-Rooter's unit-for-unit commercial demand declined 11.6% in Q3, a significant improvement from Q2's 29.1% decline. Residential demand remains strong, with Q3 revenue setting all-time records. Chemed's full-year 2020 adjusted earnings per share is now estimated at $18.00 to $18.15, up from the previous guidance of $16.20 to $16.40. Roto-Rooter is forecasted to achieve full-year revenue growth of 12.5% to 13%, while VITAS' revenue growth prior to Medicare Cap is estimated at 4% with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 21%.
