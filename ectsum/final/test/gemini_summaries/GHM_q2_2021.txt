Graham Corporation reported a strong Q2 with a revenue increase to $28 million, aided by a quick turn material order and accelerated work from an Asian subcontractor. Net income grew to $2.7 million, or $0.27 per share, due to improved margins and volume. Defense sales were robust, representing 29% of total yearly sales, driven by orders for U.S. Navy components and a solid pipeline of opportunities. Despite the impact of COVID-19 in Asia and a slowdown in short-cycle work, the company expects to convert 60-65% of its $115 million backlog within the next four quarters. This strong backlog and the acceleration of some work into Q2 provide the foundation for the company's revised guidance of $93-97 million revenue for fiscal 2021, with a gross margin of 21-23%.
