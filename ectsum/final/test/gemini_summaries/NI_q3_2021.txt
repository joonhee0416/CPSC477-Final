NiSource's strong execution of renewable energy investments remains a key growth driver, with plans to invest approximately $2 billion by 2023. The company expects to achieve the top end of its 2021 non-GAAP earnings guidance range of $1.32 to $1.36 per share and has initiated guidance for 2022 of $1.42 to $1.48, representing 6.6% growth. To meet growing demand, Columbia Gas of Ohio has filed a rate case requesting an annual revenue increase of $221 million, while NIPSCO has filed for a $115 million increase. In Pennsylvania, a settlement has been proposed with a revenue increase of $58.5 million, and in Kentucky, a settlement is expected with an $18.6 million increase. NiSource plans to retire remaining coal-fired generation at Michigan City Generating Station between 2026 and 2028, with investments of up to $750 million required to replace retiring units. The company also announced plans to evaluate hydrogen and emerging storage technologies for further decarbonization.
