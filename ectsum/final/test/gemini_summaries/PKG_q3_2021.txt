PCA reported strong Q3 earnings of $2.63 per share, driven by higher prices and volume in its Packaging segment. Packaging EBITDA margin expanded to 26%, setting new sales volume records for containerboard and corrugated products. Despite inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges, the company implemented price increases and managed costs effectively. However, Q4 earnings are expected to decline to $2.04 per share due to lower volume, higher costs such as energy and wood, and the scheduled outage at the DeRidder mill. PCA continues to invest in capital projects to maintain its production capabilities and reduce costs, while managing material availability issues. The company's cash on hand exceeds $1 billion, providing a solid financial position.
