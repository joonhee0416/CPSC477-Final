Conagra delivered solid Q1 results despite challenges, with organic net sales increasing 7% on a two-year CAGR. The company's focus on brand building and innovation drove strong sales and repeat rates across its portfolio. Consumer demand remained higher than anticipated, offsetting supply chain constraints. Conagra is reaffirming its EPS guidance of $2.50 for the year, though the path to achieving it has shifted. It expects higher inflation (now 11%) but also increased consumer demand and incremental pricing actions to offset the impact. The company is also implementing additional cost savings and supply chain efficiency measures. Conagra's portfolio, including frozen meals, snacks, and staples, aligns well with ongoing trends such as at-home eating, snacking, and changing workplace dynamics. The company remains confident in its ability to manage inflation and grow its brands in both the near and long term.
