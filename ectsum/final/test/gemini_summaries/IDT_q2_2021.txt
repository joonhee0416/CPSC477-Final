IDT Corporation reported strong financial results, including a 46% increase in consolidated revenue to $340 million, a 91% increase in consolidated income from operations to $12.9 million, and a substantial increase in fully diluted earnings per share to $0.51. These gains were driven by significant year-over-year revenue growth in higher-margin businesses, such as National Retail Solutions, BOSS Revolution Money Transfer, and net2phone-UCaaS. National Retail Solutions expanded its POS terminal network by over 1,500 units and increased revenue by 150% to $5.2 million. BOSS Revolution Money Transfer grew revenue by 73% to $13.3 million due to the expansion of its global disbursement network. Net2phone-UCaaS saw a 36% increase in subscription revenue to $10.1 million, driven by enhanced integrations with popular CRMs and communications platforms. Despite a decline in carrier services revenue, the traditional communications segment experienced strong growth in international mobile top-up sales and BOSS Revolution calling revenue, resulting in an increase in aggregate adjusted EBITDA less capex to $18.2 million.
