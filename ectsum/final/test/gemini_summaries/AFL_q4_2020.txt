Despite challenges posed by COVID-19, Aflac Incorporated reported strong financial results in 2020. Adjusted earnings per share excluding foreign exchange impacts increased 10.8%, with gains from investments and expense savings contributing to the positive performance. In Japan, total earned premium declined slightly, while persistency improved and the profit margin remained stable. In the US, sales were impacted by reduced face-to-face activity, but persistency also improved. The company accelerated investments in digital and virtual tools to adapt to the pandemic, and continues to focus on key growth initiatives. Aflac emphasized cost control and expense reduction, while also maintaining a strong capital position and declaring a dividend increase. The company anticipates the impact of pandemic conditions to persist in the first half of 2021, but remains optimistic about future growth and efficiency.
