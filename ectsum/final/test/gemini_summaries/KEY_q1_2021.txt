Key's strong first quarter was driven by positive operating leverage, record first-quarter revenue, and growth across fee-based businesses. The company's investment banking business achieved record revenues, with growth in healthcare and technology. Consumer mortgage loan originations reached a new milestone of $3 billion, with fees up 135% year-over-year. Credit quality remains strong, with net charge-offs and criticized loans declining. Key also announced the acquisition of Laurel Road, a digital bank for doctors, which exceeded expectations and accelerated digital transformation. The company maintained a strong capital position with a Tier 1 ratio of 9.8%, and returned capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Key's full-year outlook includes expectations for positive operating leverage, low single-digit net interest income growth, mid-single-digit non-interest income growth, reduced net charge-off guidance in the 35-45 basis point range, and a focus on improving productivity and efficiency.
