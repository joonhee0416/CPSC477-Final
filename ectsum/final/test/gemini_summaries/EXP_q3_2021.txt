Eagle Materials experienced a strong quarter, driven by favorable market conditions and its strategic positioning. The housing market remains robust, with a surge in homebuying and underbuilding persisting. This bodes well for Gypsum Wallboard, as well as repair and remodeling, which benefit from increased home ownership. The geographic migration to Sunbelt states aligns with Eagle's network of facilities, providing capacity for growth without additional investment. However, the cement market is constrained by high utilization rates, limiting the ability to fully capture opportunities. Price increases are expected to be the primary earnings driver for cement. Despite uncertainties surrounding the pandemic, the company remains optimistic with risks perceived as favorable. Financial performance was strong, with revenue up 18% and earnings per share from continuing operations improving 28% excluding a non-routine charge. Debt reduction has improved the company's financial flexibility, with a 41% net debt-to-cap ratio and well below 2 times net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio.
