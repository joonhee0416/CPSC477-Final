Oxford Industries reported a solid quarter, exceeding 2019 levels in combined direct-to-consumer, full price store, and e-commerce sales by 22%, with strong growth in Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer. E-commerce grew 49% in the second quarter of 2021 compared to 2019, and the company expects it to account for a third of consolidated sales this year. Despite lower traffic, retail stores saw modest growth over 2019 levels. Inventory decreased significantly year-over-year, with improvements in inventory management systems contributing to more efficient inventory usage. The company raised its outlook for the second half but anticipates headwinds from reduced inventory for clearance events, supply chain delays, and the exit of Lanier Apparel. Adjusted earnings per share for the full year are expected to be between $6.45 and $6.70, compared to $4.32 in 2019. Dividends will continue to be paid quarterly.
