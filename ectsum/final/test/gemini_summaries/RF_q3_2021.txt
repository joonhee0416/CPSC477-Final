Regions achieved earnings of $624 million, resulting in earnings per share of $0.65, driven by a growing footprint, improving unemployment levels, and strong credit quality. Net account growth exceeded the combined growth of the previous three years. The company's acquisitions of EnerBank and Sabal Capital Partners will enhance its home improvement and real estate lending capabilities. Adjusted non-interest expenses increased modestly, while the allowance for credit losses declined due to better-than-expected credit trends. Adjusted average and ending loans increased 1%, and mortgage production remained strong in consumer loans. Overall, Regions is optimistic about the economic recovery in its markets, with solid capital and liquidity positioning it for growth. However, full-year 2021 net charge-offs are expected to remain elevated due to the impact of recent acquisitions and exclude any potential future recoveries.
