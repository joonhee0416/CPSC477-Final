In the first quarter of 2020, the company reported solid results with an annualized return on average equity of 16.1% and increased direct premiums written by 15.7%. Despite an increase in the combined ratio to 94.1%, net premiums earned grew by 5.3%. The company remains optimistic about its 2020 performance, citing a debt-to-equity ratio of less than 2%, strong reinsurance renewals progress for June 1, and limited exposure to COVID-19-impacted businesses. To mitigate the pandemic's impact, the company has implemented virtual protocols and extended favorable terms to consumers. While the housing and rental markets face uncertain prospects, the company remains well-positioned and committed to meeting its consumer and stakeholder needs.
