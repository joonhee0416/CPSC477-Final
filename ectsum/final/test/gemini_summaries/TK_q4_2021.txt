Teekay Corporation reported improved Q4 results driven by modest spot tanker rate increases, resulting in an adjusted profit of $8 million or $0.08 per share, up from $0.05 per share in the previous quarter. Total adjusted EBITDA increased to $182 million from $165 million. Despite a decline in consolidated adjusted net profit for fiscal year 2021, the company noted a significant reduction in debt and a net cash position of over $300 million due to the sale of its interest in Teekay LNG. Teekay's strategic expansion in Australia through a long-term contract with the Australian government provides a stable foundation for future growth in marine services. The company is also exploring investment opportunities in the broader shipping sector and energy transition, leveraging its core competencies and financial flexibility. Moving forward, Teekay plans to adopt an event-driven approach to investor conference calls, maintaining transparency and engaging with investors through its investor relations group.
