In Q1, the company reported a 14% increase in sales to $455 million and a 206% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share to $0.52. Notably, sequential growth from Q4 to Q1 was 4%, driven by a 17% improvement in commercial activities and robust demand for airframe MRO services. Despite a 17% decline in sales to government and defense customers, the company's operating margin reached 5.5%, reflecting cost optimizations and margin expansion. Additionally, the company generated operating cash flow of $26 million excluding the impact of the accounts receivable financing program. The period also marked several new business wins, including exclusive distribution rights for commercial aviation products and government contracts for aircraft conversions and component support programs.
