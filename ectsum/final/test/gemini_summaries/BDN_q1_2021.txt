In the first quarter, the company's net income was in line with expectations, totaling $6.8 million, with a diluted EPS of $0.04. FFO was also in line at $60.2 million or $0.35 per diluted share. Portfolio operating income was below estimates due to reduced parking revenue and lower residential performance. G&A expenses decreased due to a reduction in other income, with collections remaining strong at 99%. The company expects portfolio operating income to remain flat in Q2, while FFO contribution from unconsolidated joint ventures will decrease slightly. G&A expenses are projected to increase, and land sale and tax provision are expected to generate $12 million in proceeds. The company's capital plan remains unchanged, and its leasing pipeline continues to grow, with tenants prioritizing safety and health in design and execution. With two approved mixed-use master plan sites and plans for life science development, the company anticipates significant earnings growth and remains attractive for project-level investment.
