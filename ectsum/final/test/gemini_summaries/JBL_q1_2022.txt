Jabil reported strong results in Q1, with revenue reaching $8.6 billion, a 9.4% year-over-year increase, and core operating income rising 9.6% to $400 million. This resulted in core operating margin of 4.7% and core diluted earnings per share of $1.92, a 20% improvement. Strong end-market demand, notably in healthcare, industrial, and mobility, contributed to the growth. Despite supply chain challenges, Jabil's expertise and relationships have allowed it to maintain production levels. Looking ahead, the company anticipates continued challenges but expects relief in the second half of the fiscal year, with demand exceeding supply for the next six months. Despite these challenges, Jabil has raised its full-year revenue and earnings guidance, now expecting revenue of $31.8 billion and core earnings per share of $6.55. The company's diversified portfolio, spanning healthcare, automotive, industrial, and technology sectors, has contributed to its resilience and growth, particularly in secular markets like 5G, electric vehicles, and cloud computing. Jabil's focus on domain expertise, seamless collaboration, and its unique organizational structure is driving its continued success.
