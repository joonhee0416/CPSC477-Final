First Industrial produced strong Q2 results across collections, leasing, investment, and capital markets. Rent collections remain high at 98% and rent relief requests have declined. The industrial business continues to perform well, supported by the acceleration of e-commerce and potential for additional safety stock. Despite completions exceeding net absorption nationally, the portfolio occupancy increased to 97.7% at quarter-end. Rent rates are up overall, with cash rental rates increasing 11%. The company successfully executed two capital market transactions in Q3, including a $300 million private placement of fixed-rate senior unsecured notes and an extension of its term loan, extending and laddering maturities at attractive rates. The FFO guidance range has been increased to $1.76-$1.84 per share, primarily due to the early lease-up of a large building and additional rental income from Pier 1. The company remains well-positioned to drive cash flow growth for shareholders by serving the logistics needs of essential and emerging businesses and capitalizing on secular drivers of e-commerce.
