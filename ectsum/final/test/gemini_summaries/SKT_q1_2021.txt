Tanger Outlets reported a Q1 core FFO per share of $0.40, as traffic to open-air centers nearly returned to 2019 levels in the quarter. Same-center NOI decreased 8% due to rent modifications and store closures resulting from bankruptcies and brandwide restructurings. Despite this, Tanger is optimistic about its long-term growth prospects. Consolidated portfolio occupancy improved by 20 basis points to 91.7%, while blended average rental rates decreased by 2.8% on a straight-line basis and 8.5% on a cash basis. The company expects continued pressure on retenanting spreads this year, and it anticipates additional potential store closures and rent modifications. However, Tanger remains confident in its ability to drive better rents as positive traffic and sales trends continue. The company's outlook for 2021 remains unchanged, with core FFO per share expected to be between $1.47 and $1.57.
