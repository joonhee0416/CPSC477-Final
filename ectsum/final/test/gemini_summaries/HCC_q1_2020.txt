In Q1 2020, Warrior Met Coal reported a decline in revenue and earnings compared to Q1 2019, primarily due to a 31% drop in average net selling prices and a 13% decrease in sales volumes. Adjusted net income fell 83% to $20 million or $0.39 per diluted share, significantly below the prior year's $2.30 per share. The net selling price per short ton decreased by approximately 31%, attributed to lower met coal demand and pricing. Mining cash cost of sales dropped slightly, but SG&A expenses decreased primarily due to lower corporate expenses. The company's liquidity remains strong with a leverage ratio of 0.52x adjusted EBITDA and ample liquidity of $303 million. However, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company has withdrawn its full-year 2020 guidance, delayed the Blue Creek project development, and temporarily suspended its stock repurchase program. Despite the uncertainties, Warrior Met Coal believes its strong balance sheet, low cost structure, high-quality coal portfolio, and experienced workforce will enable it to navigate the current economic challenges and achieve long-term growth.
