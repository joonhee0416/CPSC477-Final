In Q3, PROS reported revenue of $62.7 million, in line with expectations. However, due to the Delta variant's impact, total revenue for the year is projected to be at the lower end of the previous annual guidance range. Subscription revenue was $44.1 million, up 5% year-over-year, while recurring revenue accounted for 84% of total revenue. The gross revenue retention rate improved to 91% and is expected to reach 93% by year-end. Despite challenges, adjusted EBITDA loss narrowed to $4.4 million as operating expenses declined. The company expects Q4 subscription revenue and total revenue to be within specific ranges, leading to an adjusted EBITDA loss of between $9 million and $10 million. For the full year, PROS anticipates subscription revenue between $176 million and $176.5 million, total revenue between $249.5 million and $250.5 million, and an adjusted EBITDA loss of $27.3 million to $28.3 million. The company's focus on accelerating market adoption, delivering exceptional customer experiences, and expanding partnerships contributed to its positive results.
