H.B. Fuller released strong third-quarter results with double-digit growth, meeting bottom-line commitments despite significant inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges. Organic revenue surged 16% compared to 2020 and 13% versus pre-COVID levels in 2019, driven by both volume and pricing. Adjusted EBITDA and EPS surpassed guidance at $111 million and $0.79, respectively. Margin recovery is expected in Q4 and 2022 as pricing increases outpace raw material costs. The company implemented $225 million in price adjustments, with an additional surcharge planned to offset further increases. These actions are expected to generate over $400 million in annualized revenue. Demand remains robust across all three global business units, with share gains in key segments such as electric vehicles and solar panels. Innovation continues to drive growth, with new partnerships and strategic investments aimed at expanding product offerings and capacity. Full-year revenue guidance has been raised to 17-18% growth, with expectations of strong organic growth and continued margin improvements.
