Despite the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, World Fuel's global operations remained resilient, with the company absorbing risk, maintaining operations, and improving safety metrics. Consolidated volumes increased 3.5% sequentially to 3.5 billion gallons in the fourth quarter, and full-year volumes reached 14.4 billion gallons, a 26% decline from 2019. Adjusted earnings per share for the full year were $1.15, while EBITDA was $261 million. Notably, the company generated $604 million in cash flow from operations, further strengthening its balance sheet. The pandemic's impact on aviation and marine segments led to a 45% decline in consolidated gross profit year-over-year. However, the land segment saw a 3% increase in gross profit, excluding multi-service. Looking ahead, the company remains optimistic, expecting a reasonable recovery for commercial aviation activity in the second or third quarter of 2021. World Fuel emphasizes its focus on managing costs, which has mitigated over 50% of the full-year decline in gross profit. The company anticipates bad debt expense to return to pre-pandemic levels and expects to have significant capital available to invest in growth opportunities once demand recovers post-pandemic.
