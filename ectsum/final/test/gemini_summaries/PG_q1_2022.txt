P&G reported solid results for the first quarter, with organic sales growth of 4%, driven by both volume and pricing increases. Nine out of ten product categories posted organic sales growth, including double-digit growth in Personal Health Care and high-single-digit growth in Fabric Care. Despite rising commodity and transportation costs, healthy top-line growth, combined with cost savings from productivity programs, kept core earnings per share growth nearly in line with the prior year. Looking ahead, the company expects sequential earnings growth improvement as price increases take effect and productivity programs ramp up. Organic sales growth is projected to remain in the range of 2% to 4% for the fiscal year, with pricing playing a more significant role in coming quarters. However, the company is facing increased cost challenges, with a $2.3 billion after-tax headwind for fiscal 2022 earnings due to higher materials, freight, and foreign exchange costs. Despite these challenges, P&G remains committed to investing in its brands and returning cash to shareholders, with plans to pay over $8 billion in dividends and repurchase $7 billion to $9 billion of common stock.
