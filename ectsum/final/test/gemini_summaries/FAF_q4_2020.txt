First American's 2020 revenues exceeded the previous year, despite the pandemic's impact. The Title Insurance segment saw a 26% revenue increase in Q4, driven by a 32% rise in direct purchase revenue and an 11% increase in average revenue per purchase order. Specialty Insurance revenue also increased by 7%. The company implemented automation and digital measures to improve efficiency, achieving a 53% success ratio and a pre-tax margin of 18.9%. Commercial revenue rebounded strongly in Q4, improving to a 5% decline from the fourth quarter of 2019. Despite a 5% loss provision rate due to economic uncertainty, incurred claims fell below expectations. The company also benefited from a reversal of an impairment in its Property and Casualty business. First American continued investing in technology, venture investments, and share repurchases, highlighting its commitment to shareholder value creation.
