Brookdale Senior Living reported positive occupancy growth in March, a trend that continued in April, marking a turning point in the company's battle with the pandemic. The positive net move-ins and move-outs (MIMO) in March were the first since the pandemic's onset, with growth seen across all three senior living segments. Despite facing labor challenges, the company maintained rate discipline and experienced a 2.9% year-over-year increase in revenue per occupied unit (RevPOR). Brookdale's Health Care Services segment saw a revenue decline due to the pandemic and the Texas winter storm, but cost controls helped mitigate the impact. Liquidity remains strong, with the anticipated sale of the Health Care Services segment expected to generate approximately $300 million in net cash proceeds. The company anticipates sequential growth in the second quarter and stronger growth in the third quarter, supported by low active COVID-19 cases and increased move-in growth. The long-term outlook is promising, with low construction starts and a growing senior population presenting tailwinds for the industry.
