Despite the challenges of 2020, EPR Properties has maintained a strong liquidity position with over $500 million in cash on hand. The company has seen positive cash flow in the fourth quarter, leading to the paydown of their credit facility and increased confidence. Their nontheater tenants have performed well, with 94% open and rent collections improving. While theaters have faced challenges, early indications suggest robust consumer demand once product flow resumes. The company expects positive cash flow to continue, with cash collections significantly exceeding fourth-quarter levels in January (66%) and February (64%). Key customer groups are paying or have deferral agreements in place, with permanent rent reductions of approximately 5%. EPR Properties is focused on executing its investment strategy, which includes growth in experiential assets, such as ski resorts, attractions, and entertainment centers. As the vaccine rollout accelerates and people return to out-of-home experiences, the company expects to continue its recovery and return to normalcy.
