Ruger experienced a strong second quarter of 2021 with a 53.7% increase in net sales to $200.1 million and a 137.1% surge in diluted earnings per share to $2.50. This growth was driven by increased demand, favorable cost management, and improved labor efficiency. The company reported robust cash generation of $76.2 million in the first half of 2021, which it reinvested in new product development and maintained a solid balance sheet with no debt. Despite challenges posed by COVID-19, Ruger proactively implemented safety measures to protect its workforce, resulting in a 58% increase in quarterly unit production. The company plans to begin shipping Marlin lever action rifles in the fourth quarter and continues to see strong consumer demand for its products, exceeding the decline in adjusted NICS background checks. Ruger declared a quarterly dividend of $1 per share, bringing the total dividends paid in 2021 to $2.50 per share.
