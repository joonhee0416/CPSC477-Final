Albemarle Corporation exceeded expectations in 2021, with an 11% increase in net sales to $3.3 billion and a 13% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $871 million. This growth was driven by favorable market conditions for lithium and bromine. For 2022, the company anticipates further growth, with adjusted EBITDA projected to increase between 35% and 55%, primarily due to increased lithium and bromine demand. To meet this demand, Albemarle is investing heavily in capacity expansion, with the La Negra 3 and 4, Kemerton 1 and 2, and Qinzhou facilities expected to come online in the near future. In addition, the company is actively exploring the expansion of its MARBL joint venture and restarting its Kings Mountain lithium mine. Albemarle's strong balance sheet and advantages in vertical integration, resource access, and conversion capacity position it to capitalize on the growing demand for lithium and bromine.
