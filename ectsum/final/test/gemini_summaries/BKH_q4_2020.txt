Black Hills Energy delivered strong financial results for 2020, exceeding guidance with earnings per share of $3.65. The company attributes this performance to constructive regulatory outcomes in Wyoming and Nebraska, as well as customer growth across service territories. O&M expenses were controlled, increasing by only 1.5% for the full year, while capital investments in infrastructure and renewable energy projects, such as the Corriedale wind project, contributed to revenue growth. Black Hills Energy also provided long-term earnings guidance, projecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 5% from 2023 through 2025. Furthermore, the company paid out dividends for 50 consecutive years, with plans to increase the dividend by more than 5% annually through 2025. Despite issuing $100 million of equity in 2020, Black Hills Energy maintains a solid financial position with investment-grade credit ratings and a debt-to-total capitalization target in the mid-50s.
