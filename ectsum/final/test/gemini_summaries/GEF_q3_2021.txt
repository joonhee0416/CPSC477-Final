Greif reported strong Q3 results, driven by robust volume growth and strategic pricing actions. Global Industrial Packaging (GIP) experienced excellent sales and profit growth, with steel drum volumes surging by 8% globally. Latin America and EMEA also exhibited strong demand, while APAC saw moderate growth despite COVID-19 restrictions. GIP's key end markets remain healthy, with chemicals, specialty chemicals, and lubricants performing well. Paper Packaging witnessed a substantial increase in volume and selling prices due to boxboard and containerboard increases. Demand in their converting operations remains robust, with CorrChoice volumes up 27%. Despite headwinds such as OCC drag, Greif delivered record adjusted EBITDA ($238 million) and net sales, excluding foreign exchange impact (up 34% year-over-year). Adjusted EPS more than doubled to $1.93, prompting the company to raise its guidance for adjusted EPS to $5.20 (up $0.50) and adjusted free cash flow to $335-$365 million. The company also declared a 4.5% dividend increase as part of its capital deployment strategy, which prioritizes reinvestment, debt reduction, and capital returns. With a strong outlook for key end markets and efficient execution, Greif remains well-positioned for continued growth.
