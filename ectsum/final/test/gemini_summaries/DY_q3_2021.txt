In Q3, despite an 8.4% decline in revenue to $810.3 million, adjusted earnings per share grew to $1.06, a notable 20.5% increase year-over-year. This improvement was driven by higher adjusted EBITDA, which reached $92.8 million, reflecting solid gross margins of 18.7%. Despite challenges, the company capitalized on increased demand from top customers for 1 gigabit wireline and wireless networks, particularly from a large customer responsible for $8.9 million in revenue. The company's strong balance sheet also improved, with a $110 million reduction in net debt to $558.7 million, and liquidity reached an all-time high at $587.1 million. Looking forward, Q4 is expected to see slightly lower contract revenues, albeit with potentially higher or in-line margins compared to Q4 2020. The company remains confident in its long-term prospects, leveraging its customer relationships and extensive market presence to capture opportunities in fiber deployments and wireless technology advancements.
