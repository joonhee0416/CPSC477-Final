Genie Energy generated its highest level of adjusted EBITDA in any second quarter in its history, with a significant improvement from the previous year's second quarter. This was primarily driven by higher electricity consumption, warmer weather, and a shift to work-from-home during the COVID-19 pandemic. Genie Retail Energy's revenue increased by $12 million to $66.5 million, while Genie Retail Energy International's revenue grew by $2.2 million. Gross profit more than doubled to $19.5 million, with a rebound in consolidated gross margin to 25.6%. Consolidated income from operations improved by $12 million to $2.7 million, and adjusted EBITDA reached $3.5 million compared to a loss of $9.1 million in the year-ago quarter. Despite challenges related to COVID-19, Genie Energy remained resilient, posting strong financial results and resuming share repurchases while continuing to pay dividends.
