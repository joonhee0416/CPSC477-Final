Fresh Del Monte Produce faced challenges in Q3 2020 due to COVID-19, resulting in a net sales decrease to $990 million compared to $1.1 billion in Q3 2019. However, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.35, exceeding the $0.38 reported in Q3 2019. Fresh Del Monte completed the consolidation of its Mann Packing facilities, which is expected to enhance gross profit by $10 million annually. The company launched the Del Monte Pink Glow pineapple and added two new container vessels to reduce their carbon footprint and move towards their 2025 emission reduction commitment. Despite the challenges, the company generated improved cash flow and reduced debt to better navigate the pandemic.
