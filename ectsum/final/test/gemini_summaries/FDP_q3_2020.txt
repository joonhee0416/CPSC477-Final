Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, Fresh Del Monte Produce demonstrated resilience with a $0.35 adjusted earnings per share in Q3 2020, matching the previous year's performance. Net sales decreased to $990 million due to reduced demand, particularly in the foodservice channel. The company's fresh and value-added products segment experienced a decline, primarily attributed to the pandemic and the voluntary product recall in 2019. In contrast, the pineapple product line saw growth. Additionally, Fresh Del Monte Produce completed the consolidation of its Mann Packing facilities, anticipating an annual gross profit improvement of approximately $10 million. The company continued to reduce debt, which currently stands at $511 million, and announced a $100 million asset sale program to further strengthen its cash position and invest in key areas. The launch of the new pink glow Del Monte pineapple and the partnership with the United Nations Foundation to promote women's empowerment demonstrate the company's focus on sustainability and social responsibility.
