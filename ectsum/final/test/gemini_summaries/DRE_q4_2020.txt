Duke Realty had a remarkable 2020, despite challenges posed by the pandemic and recession, exceeding original operating and financial objectives. The company signed 21 million square feet of leases, maintained 97-98% stabilized portfolio occupancy, grew same-property NOI by 5%, and achieved a record-high 96% total portfolio occupancy. Strong market fundamentals continue, with exceptional demand in the logistics sector driving rents up 8.3% in the fourth quarter, and this trend is expected to continue in 2021. Notably, the company signed significant leases in Northern New Jersey and Southern California, pre-leasing 69% of its $1.1 billion development pipeline, primarily focused on coastal Tier 1 markets. Duke Realty's 2021 guidance projects core FFO growth of 8.6%, AFFO growth between 5.8% and 10.1%, and development starts ranging from $700 million to $900 million. With a strong prospect list for new starts and land allocation in coastal Tier 1 markets, the company remains well-positioned for future growth.
