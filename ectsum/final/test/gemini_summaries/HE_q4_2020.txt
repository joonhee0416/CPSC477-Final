In 2020, Hawaiian Electric Industries (HEI) reported consolidated net income of $197.8 million and EPS of $1.81 despite challenges posed by the pandemic. The utility segment drove earnings growth through cost-saving initiatives and efficiency enhancements, partially offset by impacts from a settled rate case. The bank division faced headwinds due to low interest rates and increased provisioning but still performed well, delivering solid profitability and record mortgage originations. HEI's recent dividend increase reflects its continued financial performance and confidence in future prospects.

The company's strategic priorities include decarbonization, resilience, stakeholder engagement, and financial strength. HEI's utilities continue to aggressively advance renewable energy procurement and storage projects, with nine Stage 2 RFPs filed and three approved by the PUC. They are also working to enhance customer experience and grid modernization, with new initiatives such as the Quick Connect program for faster rooftop solar interconnection. HEI's focus on cost management will enable it to navigate the PBR framework effectively.

The bank is facing ongoing pressure from low interest rates, but cost containment and digital transformation efforts are key priorities. HEI expects average annual utility earnings growth in the 4% to 5% range over the next several years under PBR. Bank guidance remains conservative due to economic uncertainty but reflects continued profitability. HEI's strong financial position and improved earnings outlook have allowed for dividend growth while maintaining investment-grade ratings.
