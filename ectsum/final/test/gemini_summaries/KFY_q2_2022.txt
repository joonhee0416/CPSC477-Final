Korn Ferry achieved record financial performance with revenue up 47% and adjusted earnings per share at $1.38 and $1.53 diluted and undiluted, respectively. The company's adjusted EBITDA margin reached 21.1%. The growth was driven by a 30% cross-referral rate, indicating the effectiveness of their go-to-market strategy. Despite search businesses constituting 45% of revenue, the company sees significant market opportunity in the nomadic labor market, evidenced by the acquisition of Lucas Group. Additionally, Korn Ferry will continue to innovate in digital and consulting, leveraging its Advance platform and focusing on ESG, DE&I, and M&A services. Balanced capital allocation, including disciplined M&A, remains a priority. With strong momentum and a portfolio that aligns with secular changes, Korn Ferry anticipates continued growth in the New Year, with estimated Q3 fee revenue between $640 million and $660 million and expected adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $1.42 to $1.58.
