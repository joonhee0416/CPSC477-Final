In Q2, the company reported solid results with an accelerated organic ASV plus professional services growth rate of 5.5%, driven by increased wallet share and price hikes. Growth was particularly strong in the Americas (6%), Asia-Pac (9%), and EMEA (4%), with wins in research, CTS data feeds, and wealth solutions. Investments in content and technology progressed well, leading to increased adoption of enhanced workstation offerings. The company raised the lower end of its full-year organic ASV growth guidance to $70 million, supported by strong demand and a robust sales pipeline. Despite geopolitical uncertainties, the company remains optimistic about its long-term prospects due to its focus on digital transformation, personalized solutions, and market positioning in the trend towards integrated front, middle, and back office solutions.
