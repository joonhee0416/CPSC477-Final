Northwest Natural's Q1 financial performance was solid, with net income per share increasing from $1.58 to $1.94. Key drivers include new rates in Oregon, customer growth, and improved interstate storage business results. The Gas Utility saw higher earnings, partially offset by increased depreciation and expenses. Other businesses benefited from higher asset management revenues and growth in water and wastewater utilities. Cash provided by operating activities increased, and the company maintains a strong balance sheet. Northwest Natural reaffirmed its 2021 earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share, expecting continued customer growth and average weather conditions. The company remains committed to environmental stewardship, with a goal of carbon neutrality by 2050, and has made progress towards its 30% carbon savings target. Northwest Natural has also been recognized for its high customer satisfaction ratings and water utility investments, including proactive infrastructure improvements and safety enhancements.
