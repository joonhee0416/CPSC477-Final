Spirit Aerosystems reported positive signs of recovery in domestic air traffic, with TSA passenger screenings exceeding 2 million daily on multiple occasions and even surpassing 2019 levels in July. Despite a recent spike in COVID-19 cases, the upward momentum in domestic air traffic remains encouraging. The company's 737 production increased by 73% in the first half of this year compared to last year, and Spirit expects to deliver 160 shipsets in 2021, a 125% increase from 2020. Spirit also highlighted the progress in integrating recent acquisitions, including Applied Aerodynamics and Bombardier's Belfast, Morocco, and Dallas sites. The company anticipates improved performance in the second half of the year as narrow-body production rates continue to rise and Boeing's 737 MAX returns to service. Despite a forward loss on the 787 program due to fit and finish issues, Spirit maintained its free cash flow guidance of negative $200 million to $300 million for 2021.
