LP reported record-breaking results in Q1 driven by strong customer demand for SmartSide and OSB. SmartSide net sales surged by 50% to $283 million, with EBITDA doubling to $90 million. OSB prices remained high, resulting in extraordinary cash flow for the segment. LP's South American operations also performed well, with sales and EBITDA tripling compared to Q1 2020. The company expects this momentum to continue in Q2, with SmartSide sales estimated to increase by 30% or more year-over-year, and OSB revenue projected to be 30% higher sequentially. LP's capacity expansion plans are progressing, including the conversion of its Houlton, Maine mill to SmartSide production and the restart of its Peace Valley OSB mill. The company is also exploring options to accelerate the conversion of its Sagola, Michigan mill. Despite supply chain challenges with adhesives used in TechShield production, LP anticipates a return to normal levels by the end of the quarter. LP's strategic sourcing and collaborative efforts between its Siding and OSB operations allowed it to navigate the recent MDI shortage and allocate resources effectively. The company raised its capital expenditure guidance to $230-$250 million, reflecting plans to accelerate its SmartSide capacity expansion. Overall, LP's Q1 results and guidance for Q2 highlight its strong financial position and its commitment to meeting the growing demand for its products.
