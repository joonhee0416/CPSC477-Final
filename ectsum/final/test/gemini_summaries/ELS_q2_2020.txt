ELV's second-quarter results showcase sustained business resilience. Despite COVID-19, MH rental revenue increased by 4.6%, while RV income grew by 4.7% from annual customers. MH occupancy reached 95%, while renter count decreased. New home sales volume and average purchase price also increased by 14% and 10% respectively. The company's strong demand for controlled travel environments led to a significant increase in RV reservation activity and revenue in June. Normalized FFO per share for the quarter was $0.47, and overall rent collection rates remained at 99%, consistent with Q2 2019. Despite the pandemic, the team has successfully implemented new safety protocols and adapted to the operating environment. ELV's financial position remains strong, with available liquidity exceeding $550 million, including an unsecured line of credit, ATM program capacity, and no scheduled debt maturities for the next 12 months.
