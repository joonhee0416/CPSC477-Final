AECOM delivered strong results in fiscal 2021, exceeding expectations on key metrics. NSR rose 6.5% in Q4 and 14.8% for the year, reaching record margins of 13.8%. Adjusted operating margins increased by 30 basis points in Q4 to 7.4% internationally, while the Americas posted an all-time high of 19.8%. Adjusted EBITDA and EPS growth for the year were 11% and 31%, respectively, with $830 million in EBITDA and $2.82 in EPS. Free cash flow totaled $583 million. Key growth drivers include strong wins in Program Management, particularly in the Middle East, and leadership in ESG. AECOM has repurchased 13% of its shares since last September and remains committed to repurchasing stock, viewing it as the best use of capital after growth investments. The Company has set a long-term goal of achieving at least $4.75 in adjusted EPS by fiscal 2024, a significant increase from previous projections.
