In 2021, Northwest Natural reported net income of $2.56 per share, an 11% increase from 2020. Higher rates in Oregon and Washington, along with solid customer growth, fueled the increase. The company also reported a 3% organic customer growth rate in its water and wastewater utilities due to strong residential housing construction. Acquisitions played a significant role, increasing water utility connections by nearly 30%. In gas facilities, new rates implemented in November 2021 resulted in a 30% price advantage over electric or oil formats. Northwest Natural remains committed to its sustainability goals, with RNG accounting for 3% of the company's current annual sales volume in Oregon. Additionally, the company has targeted a long-term earnings-per-share growth rate of 4% to 6% from 2022 to 2027, supported by expected customer growth, average weather conditions, and continued investment in water utilities and renewable natural gas.
