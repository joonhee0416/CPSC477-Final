In Q3 2020, the company achieved an adjusted EPS of $0.91, a 21% increase over Q3 2019, and adjusted EBITDA of $58 million, a 13% increase. Growth in worksite employee volume and pricing, along with lower-than-expected direct costs, contributed to the outperformance. As the pandemic eased, businesses began rehiring, resulting in a rebound in paid worksite employees. Client retention remained high at 99%, despite economic pressures. The company's financial position remains strong, with increased adjusted cash and a $130 million remaining credit facility availability. The company continues to invest in its sales force, develop new products, and respond to the changing needs of clients. For Q4, the company forecasts an adjusted EBITDA of $21-$30 million and adjusted EPS of $0.20-$0.38, driven by continued worksite employee growth, strong pricing, and manageable direct costs. The full-year 2020 guidance is now adjusted EBITDA of $271 million-$281 million (an increase of 8%-12%) and adjusted EPS of $4.35-$4.53.
