Dynex Capital reported strong third-quarter results, driven by higher earning asset yields and TBA drop income contribution, resulting in a 4 basis point increase in their adjusted net interest spread to 2.1%. Earnings available for distribution increased 6% over the previous quarter to $0.54 per share, well above their $0.39 quarterly dividend. Book value per common share slightly declined to $18.42, primarily due to economic losses on the investment portfolio, which has since recovered post-quarter end. Despite increased G&A expenses, the company's adjusted leverage declined to 5.9 times at the end of the quarter. Dynex Capital remains cautiously optimistic, maintaining flexibility and dry powder for future investments while navigating an uncertain economic environment. The company anticipates continued earnings available for distribution at or above current dividend levels in the fourth quarter, providing a cushion for book value. With a resilient portfolio and over $500 million in liquidity, Dynex Capital is well-positioned to capitalize on opportunities in the evolving market landscape.
