Despite the challenges of the pandemic, the company achieved a strong fourth-quarter performance, notably exceeding profit expectations due to favorable product mix and higher demand for tower cranes in Europe. Orders and backlog increased significantly, driven by large crawler orders and favorable exchange rates. Inventory reduction targets were met, resulting in improved cash flow. For the full year, orders declined 8% but adjusted EBITDA margins improved. Looking ahead to 2021, the company anticipates a year of transition marked by economic recovery and cost headwinds. Stimulus packages and COVID-19 vaccines are driving optimism, but concerns over inflation, currency fluctuations, and rising costs may create challenges. Despite these headwinds, the company remains committed to investing in growth initiatives, such as expanding its tower crane rental fleet, scaling up its Chinese business, and pursuing acquisitions. As a result, the company expects revenue to rise modestly in 2021, but margins may face pressure from cost headwinds and product mix shifts.
