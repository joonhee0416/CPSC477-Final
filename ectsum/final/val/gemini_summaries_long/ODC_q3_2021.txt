In Q3 FY21, Oil-Dri's net sales of $76.3 million aligned with the record Q3 2020 sales. The business-to-business segment saw a 1% decrease to $26.3 million, with growth in agricultural and animal health products offset by declines in cat litter, co-packaging, and bleaching clay. The retail and wholesale segment grew by 1% to a record $50 million, driven by industrial and sports products. Despite higher freight, packaging, and material costs, the company experienced a 7% decrease in SG&A expenses due to reduced travel and bad debt. Net income decreased significantly to $2.2 million ($0.32 EPS) from $4.6 million ($0.65 EPS) in Q3 2020. To mitigate rising costs, the company implemented price increases effective May 1, with further increases likely in the consumer business. Oil-Dri's cash position remains strong, with $30 million in cash and cash equivalents and a low debt ratio of 6%. The company remains well-positioned for future growth opportunities.
