Despite the significant challenges posed by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Choice Hotels continues to outperform the industry with a domestic systemwide RevPAR decline of only 28.8% in Q3 compared to 2019. The company attributed this success to its diversified brand portfolio, geographic footprint, and franchise-focused business model. Emerging trends, such as remote work, increased road trips, and higher relocation rates, also present growth opportunities. Choice Hotels is experiencing strong demand for its upscale, extended-stay, and mid-scale brands, with occupancy rates exceeding 50% since late June. Notably, Comfort, the company's flagship brand, has exhibited positive growth in both units and rooms due to its transformation. The effective royalty rate has also increased, reflecting the value proposition for franchisees. The company's cash and liquidity position remains strong, and it expects the impact of COVID-19 on its year-over-year RevPAR change to be less significant in Q4 compared to Q3. With its long-term focus and disciplined capital allocation strategy, Choice Hotels remains confident in its ability to succeed in the post-pandemic environment.
