ARMOUR REIT's Q4 comprehensive income reached $60.2 million, resulting in $0.89 earnings per share. Despite lower core earnings due to tighter spreads and higher mortgage prepayments, the company maintained its dividend rate of $0.10 per share. ARMOUR REIT continues to focus on Agency MBS, with 94% of its portfolio featuring prepayment protection characteristics. While anticipating the Fed's presence in the market for the first half of 2021, ARMOUR has adopted a cautious approach, reducing its leverage ratio and managing net duration within a defined range. The company's portfolio convexity profile remains favorable, with a significant portion of duration in key rate buckets where yields are expected to remain low. ARMOUR REIT is committed to protecting book value and optimizing total economic return, while acknowledging the potential for lower core earnings.
