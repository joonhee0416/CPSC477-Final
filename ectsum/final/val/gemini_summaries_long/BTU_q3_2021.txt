Peabody's Q3 results reflected strong global coal demand, yielding quarterly margins not seen since 2018. Global markets remain favorable, with elevated coal prices supported by increased demand, constrained supply, and supply chain disruptions. The company's diverse asset portfolio positioned it to capture these market conditions, generating substantial EBITDA across its seaborne thermal, seaborne met, and U.S. thermal segments. Notably, the seaborne met segment achieved record production and lower costs, while the U.S. thermal mines delivered solid margins despite labor challenges. Peabody remains committed to expanding production, reducing debt, and enhancing financial resilience through initiatives like multiyear contracts, debt retirement, and strategic partnerships. The company's Q3 revenue exceeded $679 million, with adjusted EBITDA tripling year-over-year to $289 million. Additionally, Peabody secured long-term sales agreements for its Twentymile and Illinois Basin mines, ensuring continued operations and improved pricing.
