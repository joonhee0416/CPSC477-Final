Capital One reported a third-quarter profit of $3.1 billion, driven by loan growth, margin expansion, and strong credit performance. Earnings per diluted common share were $6.78, or $6.86 excluding a legal reserve build. Pre-provision earnings rose 7% year-over-year, while revenue increased 6%. Notably, the allowance balance declined by $770 million due to continued strong credit performance and a reduction in qualitative factors. This led to a provision benefit, more than offsetting record-low charge-offs. The company's preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the third quarter remained robust at 143%. Net interest margin improved to 6.35%, largely driven by a decline in average cash balances, margin expansion in the domestic card business, and loan growth. Capital One continues to invest in technology and marketing to drive growth, particularly in its domestic card business, where revenue margin expanded by 218 basis points year-over-year. Credit performance remained strong across all segments, with the domestic card charge-off rate improving by 228 basis points year-over-year. The company also repurchased $2.7 billion in common stock and announced plans to redeem outstanding preferred stock, resulting in an expected decline in preferred dividends in the first quarter.
