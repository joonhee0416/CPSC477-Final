Old Republic International reported strong second-quarter results with net income of $124 million, driven by a record-breaking Title Insurance segment. Despite the pandemic's impact on its General Insurance segment, premium revenue grew overall by 1.5%. Title Insurance Group, contributing to 16% growth year-over-year, set a new production record. The mortgage run-off business continued to decline as expected. The consolidated combined ratio marginally increased, while claim ratios improved and expense ratios rose due to a shift towards the higher-expense Title Insurance business. The company's investment portfolio experienced a recovery, with book value per share increasing to $19.68 at the end of June. Old Republic remains optimistic about the future, with a robust order count for both purchase and refinance transactions and favorable mortgage rates, despite ongoing challenges in the General Insurance segment.
