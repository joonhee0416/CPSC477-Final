Rayonier's second quarter reported a robust financial performance, reflecting solid growth across all timber segments and despite a decline in real estate earnings. Pro forma earnings per share reached $0.22, driven by increased adjusted EBITDA of $95 million, which exceeded the prior year by 21%. Southern Timber reported a 16% EBITDA growth due to higher net stumpage prices. The Pacific Northwest Timber segment experienced a significant improvement in EBITDA, primarily stemming from elevated delivered saw timber prices and increased log export demand. New Zealand Timber nearly tripled its adjusted EBITDA, benefiting from significantly higher harvest volumes and weighted average log prices. Real Estate EBITDA declined but remained healthy, with a focus on commercial and residential development projects. Rayonier also sold its Timber Funds business, which aligns with its strategy of simplifying operations and focusing on core competencies. The company modestly raised its full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance to $300-320 million, anticipates net income of $98-106 million with earnings per share of $0.69-0.75, and projects pro forma earnings per share of $0.51-0.57. The exit from the Timber Funds business, coupled with targeted acquisitions and capital allocation, positions Rayonier for continued growth in the future.
