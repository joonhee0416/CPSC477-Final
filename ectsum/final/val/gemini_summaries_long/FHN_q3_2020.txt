First Horizon National Corp. experienced a significant quarter marked by the completion of the IBERIABANK merger and the acquisition of SunTrust Truist branches. Despite the challenging operating environment, the company reported solid performance with adjusted financial results largely in line with estimates. Net interest income rose to $532 million, driven by the merger impact, while net interest margin remained stable at 2.84%. Fee income remained stable, with counter-cyclical businesses such as fixed income and mortgage banking mitigating COVID-related pressures. The company focused on controlling expenses, capturing $8 million in run rate savings towards its $170 million target. Strong deposit inflows and interest rate adjustments resulted in a decline in interest bearing deposit costs. However, excess cash levels impacted the net interest margin. Asset quality remained benign, with net charge-offs at 44 basis points, although nonperforming assets showed a slight uptick. The company maintained a strong balance sheet with a CET1 ratio of 9.15% and ample loss absorption capacity of $1.3 billion. Integration progress remains on track, with $18 million in cost savings realized to date. The company expects to complete the significant integration work by early fall 2021. Overall, First Horizon expressed confidence in its business model and emphasized its well-positioned capital, liquidity, and expense control capabilities to navigate the challenges and capitalize on potential opportunities.
