Monument Realty continues to progress in its transformation into a multifamily REIT, with over 55% of its $450 million expansion target already deployed or under contract. The company has acquired The Oxford, a 240-unit property in Conyers, Georgia, and has two additional acquisitions in process, with another $97 million property moving toward a binding contract. These acquisitions align with Monument's strategy of targeting Class B and value-add properties with high NOI growth potential. The southeastern markets, including Atlanta, Raleigh-Durham, and Charlotte, are experiencing strong rent growth due to economic and wage growth, which aligns with Monument's expansion goals. The company is also preparing to bring property-level management in-house, with phase one implementation planned for year-end. New lease rate growth has remained strong, with 9% growth in September and 11% in October on an effective basis, and a decline in concessions to pre-COVID levels. The positive lease rate momentum is expected to continue into the spring and summer leasing seasons in 2022, with strong NOI growth anticipated.
