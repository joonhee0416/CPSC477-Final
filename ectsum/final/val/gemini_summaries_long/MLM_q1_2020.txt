Despite a strong Q1 performance exceeding expectations, Martin Marietta withdrew its 2020 guidance due to COVID-19 uncertainty. However, the company remains optimistic about its long-term potential. In April, aggregate shipments remained elevated, cement shipments remained steady, and ready-mixed concrete shipments were near prior year levels. Pricing also improved for aggregates, cement, and ready-mixed concrete. Despite these positive trends, the company anticipates weaker demand in the coming months, with private sector projects being affected sooner than public sector projects. To mitigate risks, Martin Marietta is focusing on cash flow generation, liquidity preservation, and cost adjustments. The company's strong geographic and competitive position, experienced leadership team, and strategic plans support its confidence in navigating challenging times and emerging stronger. The company has strengthened its balance sheet through a bond offering and is cutting nonessential costs, reducing capital spending, and implementing hiring restrictions to align with demand.
