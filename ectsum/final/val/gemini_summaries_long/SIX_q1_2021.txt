Despite COVID-19 challenges, Six Flags reported a strong start to the 2021 season. As of April 4th, attendance at open parks reached 79% of 2019 levels, surpassing the 51% reported in Q4 2020. Total revenue for Q1 2021 was $82 million, a 36% decrease from 2019. Six Flags faced labor shortages due to various factors, which may ease as the season progresses. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was a loss of $46 million, with a GAAP loss per share of $1.12, primarily due to lower attendance. The company's active pass base remains strong with 4.1 million pass holders, though it has declined slightly since 2019. Total guest spending per capita increased by 16% compared to 2019, driven by higher ticket and in-park spending. Six Flags anticipates $30-$35 million in incremental EBITDA in 2021 from its transformation plan, which includes organizational redesign and cost reductions. The company expects to invest slightly less capital in 2021 compared to 2020. Six Flags expressed optimism about the upcoming season, citing strong consumer demand, a growing active pass base, and progress in its transformation plan to improve the guest experience and profitability.
