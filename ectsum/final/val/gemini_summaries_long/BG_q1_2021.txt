Bunge reported strong Q1 financials with adjusted earnings per share of $3.13, a significant increase from $0.91 last year, driven by strong performance in its Agribusiness and Refined and Specialty Oils segments. The company cited increased demand and margins in its soy and softseed crush value chains, as well as record volume utilization. In Refined and Specialty Oils, improved execution and favorable market conditions drove higher results. Bunge has also strengthened its balance sheet, with net debt now funded by 91% of its readily marketable inventory. Amidst ongoing COVID-19 challenges, the company remains optimistic about the demand environment and has raised its full-year adjusted earnings per share outlook to approximately $7.50 per share.
