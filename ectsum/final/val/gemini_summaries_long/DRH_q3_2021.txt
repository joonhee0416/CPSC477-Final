Q3 was strong for DiamondRock, with hotel profits hitting pandemic-era highs. RevPAR was within 20% of 2019 levels, with 12 hotels exceeding 2019 results and five setting all-time highs. This performance exceeded expectations, driven by the company's geographic footprint and maximized travel demand. The company benefited from taking nearly 1,300 basis points of RevPAR index from competitors and leveraging short-term management agreements for greater cost control. This combination resulted in $38.9 million of adjusted EBITDA and $0.10 of positive adjusted FFO per share. Travel demand increased in all segments, with leisure leading the recovery. Group and business transient also showed acceleration, with BT revenue jumping to 84% of 2019 levels. The outlook for group is positive, with lead generation reaching over 12,400 leads and an encouraging recovery in meeting plans despite the Delta variant. DiamondRock is pursuing ROI projects to drive cash flow growth in 2022, with several repositionings expected to deliver IRRs over 30%. The company remains financially strong, with $538 million of total liquidity and conservative leverage. It expects to remain an active acquirer of on-strategy properties. Despite the impact of wildfires in Northern California, the company anticipates outperforming initial underwriting for its Bourbon Hotel and Henderson Park Inn acquisitions. Effective labor management strategies have maintained gross operating profit flow-through at a consistent 45%. Group revenue has accelerated, with on-the-books revenue for 2022 increasing 14% from Q2 and nearly 50% above the forecast for 2021. Strong convention calendars in key markets and citywide room nights indicate further group recovery. DiamondRock highlights its competitive advantages, including favorable market exposure, recent repositionings, high percentage of terminable operating agreements, and industry-leading asset management capabilities.
