HNI Corporation's strong second-quarter performance included a 100% year-over-year increase in non-GAAP earnings per share to $0.40. The Residential Building Products segment saw exceptional growth, with revenue exceeding 50% and operating profit more than doubling. Workplace Furnishings is recovering, with organic sales up 9% and orders growing 32% due to increased demand in small-to-mid-sized and public sector markets. For the third quarter, revenue growth is expected to be in the mid-20% range, driven by both Residential Building Products and Workplace Furnishings segments. While cost challenges related to inflation and growth investments will impact profitability, margins are anticipated to expand post-third quarter as recent price actions take effect. The company remains optimistic about its prospects, with multiple growth initiatives in progress and a strong competitive position in both segments.
