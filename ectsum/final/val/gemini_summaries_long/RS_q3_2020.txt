Reliance Steel & Aluminum's Q3 exceeded expectations, with a 37.5% increase in non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to $1.80, primarily driven by a record gross profit margin of 32.4%. Despite a 4.3% decline in average selling price per ton sold due to product mix changes, increased gross profit was a major factor. Notably, the company's toll processing volumes rebounded significantly, contributing to higher gross profit margins. Demand in nonresidential construction continued to improve, while aerospace remained weak. However, Reliance anticipates a continued slow improvement in overall demand in Q4 2020. Despite seasonal factors, tons sold are expected to decline by 4% to 6% in Q4, while average selling price is projected to be flat to up 2%. Based on these expectations, the company anticipates non-GAAP earnings per diluted share between $1.30 and $1.40 for Q4.
