MSA's third-quarter financial performance was solid, with revenue rising 12% to $340 million, driven by core organic product growth in fire service and industrial PPE segments. Despite the challenges posed by supply chain disruptions, the backlog increased significantly by $50 million year-over-year. Notably, record backlog levels are observed in gas detection and firefighter apparel. The company's strong balance sheet provides opportunities for inorganic growth, with the recent acquisition of Bacharach making progress in integration efforts. MSA continues to lead in safety technology, recently introducing the ALTAIR io4 connected work platform, which enhances safety and efficiency. The company is recognized for its employee engagement and has implemented strategic programs to attract and retain talent. The supply chain challenges persist, impacting fulfillment capabilities but not altering customer orders. Management remains confident in MSA's strategy and its ability to navigate the current environment, citing the strength of its brand, associate dedication, and ongoing investment in innovation.
