Despite challenges, Greif delivered excellent results in fiscal 2021, with record financial performance and significant progress in ESG initiatives. The Global Industrial Packaging (GIP) segment experienced increased volumes and higher selling prices, leading to higher profits. Paper Packaging also saw higher demand and pricing, resulting in improved profits. The company's diversified portfolio enabled the higher GIP earnings to offset lower profits in the coming fiscal year due to a decline in steel costs. Greif's strong financial position includes a reduced debt load, which will significantly lower interest expenses in fiscal 2022. The company's adjusted Class A earnings per share for fiscal 2022 are projected at $6.15. Importantly, despite these improvements, Greif believes its valuation is undervalued compared to its historical metrics and deserves a higher market cap.
