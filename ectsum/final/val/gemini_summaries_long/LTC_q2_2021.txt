In the second quarter, LTC's revenue increased primarily due to higher rental revenue from new development projects, offset by reduced rent from Senior Lifestyle. Despite ongoing challenges, occupancy gains were recorded for the first time in a while, with skilled nursing facilities showing a gradual upward trend. The senior lifestyle portfolio transition is nearly complete, with most buildings under new leases or sold. Senior Care Center's bankruptcy proceedings are ongoing, but deal flow continues to accelerate with several potential transactions in the pipeline. LTC remains cautious about acquisitions, focusing on structured finance transactions with reduced risk profiles and strong returns. The dividend payout ratio was high at 98% due to financial support provided to operators and senior lifestyle defaults but is expected to improve in the future. LTC's strong credit metrics, lack of significant debt maturities, and adequate liquidity provide flexibility for future growth and investment. Overall, the industry is believed to be on more solid footing, with the hope that any surge in the delta variant will be addressed locally rather than nationally.
