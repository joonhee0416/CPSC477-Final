AutoNation reported a record-breaking quarter with a 207% YoY increase in adjusted earnings per share to $2.79. Revenue grew 27% to $5.90 billion, driven by strong demand for new and used vehicles. The company's focus on self-sourcing pre-owned vehicles and digital capabilities contributed to same-store used vehicle unit sales growth of 28% and a 52% increase in variable gross profit. Despite supply constraints, demand continues to exceed supply. AutoNation plans to double shipments in the second quarter compared to last year, expand its AutoNation USA concept, and acquire 11 stores. The company remains committed to disciplined expense management and targets an SG&A ratio of 65% or less for 2021, resulting in a significant improvement compared to prior years. AutoNation's strong financial performance and customer-focused approach position it for continued growth and shareholder value creation.
