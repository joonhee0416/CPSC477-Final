In Q3, DHI Group experienced a moderate revenue decline of 11% to $33.3 million, primarily driven by a 13% decrease in Dice revenue. Despite this, adjusted EBITDA remained steady at 23%, meeting the company's target of approximately 20% margins. Product innovation continued at a strong pace, with notable releases including Dice IntelliSearch Based Job Alerts, Dice Recruiter Profile, and eFinancialsCareers' "Follow," "Voice," and "Video" features. Industry analysts project a significant rebound in the IT staffing market in 2021, with job postings increasing in September. However, eFinancialCareers continues to face challenges due to the ongoing impact of COVID-19 in its main markets, the UK and APAC. Despite these headwinds, DHI remains focused on executing its plan to create career marketplaces for matching tech professionals and employers, with confidence in its long-term growth prospects.
