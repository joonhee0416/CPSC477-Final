NOV's Q1 2021 earnings reflect a sharp decline in revenue and profitability, primarily due to the combined impact of the oil price war and COVID-19 pandemic. Despite challenges, the company achieved sequential growth in certain Wellbore Technologies segments, particularly in North America. Wellbore Technologies is expected to continue posting sequential revenue growth, supported by improved activity in the US and Latin America. The Completion & Production Solutions segment experienced a significant decline due to depleted backlogs and supply chain disruptions, but is expected to improve in the second quarter. Rig Technologies continues to face weak capital equipment orders, but is seeing increased demand for spare parts. The company remains optimistic about the recovery in the oilfield, citing rising oil prices, increasing demand for services, and the growing need for well reactivation and construction. NOV's strong product portfolio and cost-cutting initiatives position it to benefit from the expected recovery.
