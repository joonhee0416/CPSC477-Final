In December, January, and February, the company witnessed a strong start to 2021, with January marking the first positive EBITDA month for their hotels. The portfolio delivered a RevPAR of over $60, with South Florida and Washington DC offsetting declines on the West Coast and in the Northeast. Leisure demand is expected to drive the recovery, with pent-up demand exceeding last summer's levels. Corporate travel is also anticipated to return in the second quarter and ramp up throughout the year. Drive-to resorts have been strong performers, with a weighted average occupancy of 40% and 2% ADR growth in 2020. Government shutdowns impacted coastal California properties in December and January, but performance is improving with the lifting of restrictions. New York City's performance was strong in Q4, ending with close to 40% occupancy despite limited leisure attractions. Urban market recovery is expected to be enhanced by the return of business travel, reduced supply, and a proposed zoning change requiring special permits for new hotels in New York City. The company is pursuing a $150-$200 million capital raise, with asset sales expected to generate $191 million in net proceeds. The sale of mature and capital-intensive hotels will reduce capex requirements by approximately $20 million over the coming years. The addition of an unsecured term loan facility from Goldman Sachs Merchant Bank provides financial flexibility and extends the covenant waiver until June 2022. The company has cleared its credit facility runway and is focused on operating efficiently and capturing market share.
