Vulcan Materials reported a solid first half of 2021, with a 7% increase in adjusted EBITDA and a 5% increase in aggregates cash gross profit per ton. Despite headwinds from higher diesel and liquid asphalt costs, aggregates cash gross profit per ton still increased by 2% in the second quarter. The momentum is expected to continue in the second half of the year, and the company reiterated its full-year 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance of $1.38 billion to $1.46 billion. The residential end-use has shown continued strength, and there has been an uptick in multifamily housing starts. Nonresidential demand continues to improve, especially in e-commerce and technology infrastructure. The company is also encouraged by the progress made toward a Highway Bill with substantially higher funding. Vulcan is committed to driving growth through organic growth, greenfields, and M&A, with the recently announced acquisition of U.S. Concrete being a strategic fit. The company's focus on pricing realization, unit profitability, return on invested capital, and balance sheet strength will continue to support its long-term growth.
