Synovus Financial Corporation reported strong third-quarter results, demonstrating adaptability and resilience amid the ongoing pandemic. Diluted earnings per share were $0.56, with adjusted earnings per share reaching $0.89. An impairment charge of $45 million led to the difference between reported and adjusted figures. The company experienced net loan growth of $245 million, partially offset by asset dispositions and P3 loan payoffs. Total deposits increased by $471 million, with core transaction deposit growth allowing for strategic deposit pricing and remixing, which resulted in stable net interest income of $377 million. Adjusted non-interest revenue of $116 million was up from the previous quarter, primarily due to increased net mortgage revenues and core banking fees. Adjusted non-interest expense declined by $8 million, led by lower employment expenses. The provision for credit losses was $43 million, down from the prior quarter. Key credit metrics remained relatively stable, with past due NPA and net charge-off ratios remaining unchanged. Strong cash inflows and positive industry trends indicate a gradual recovery in the portfolio. Synovus Forward initiatives are underway to drive efficiency and generate new revenue streams, with the goal of realizing $100 million in incremental pre-tax income. The company plans to continue prudent expense management and earnings growth, supporting its capital position and strategic objectives.
