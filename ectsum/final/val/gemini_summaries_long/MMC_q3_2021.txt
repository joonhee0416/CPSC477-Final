Marsh McLennan reported a strong third quarter, fueled by "solid demand" for its differentiated advice and solutions in the face of macroeconomic uncertainty and volatility. All businesses experienced growth, with highlights including 13% underlying revenue growth in Risk and Insurance Services, which includes Marsh and Guy Carpenter, and 12% growth in Consulting, which includes Mercer and Oliver Wyman. Notably, Mercer achieved its highest underlying revenue growth in over a decade, driven by demand for its Career and Wealth services, while Oliver Wyman delivered a second consecutive quarter of over 20% growth. Overall, consolidated revenue increased 16% to $4.6 billion, adjusted operating income grew 19%, and adjusted earnings per share surged 32% to $1.08. Despite challenges, insurance market conditions remain favorable, with consistent rate increases across lines, particularly in cyber and financial and professional lines. Investment income remains a modest contributor, while taxes continue to impact profitability.
