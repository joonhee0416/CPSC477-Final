LTC reported a challenging industry environment due to the pandemic, particularly with regards to labor shortages. In LTC's portfolio, occupancy rates are increasing, vaccination rates are high, and potential COVID-related mandates hold promise for reducing the impact of the virus in facilities. Rent collections have improved, with 94% of rent received excluding Senior Care and Senior Lifestyle portfolios. LTC completed $46 million in new investments, primarily in strategic finance deals, and has a healthy pipeline of potential investments. Despite challenges, the industry is seeing recovery signs, and LTC remains well-positioned due to its strong balance sheet and focus on providing financing solutions to regional operators. The company's goal is to return to growth in 2022, leveraging favorable industry demographics and partnerships with experienced operators.
