Moody's reported strong financial results in the second quarter of 2021, showcasing robust demand for their risk assessment offerings. Revenue increased 8%, driven by a surge in leveraged finance issuance and the expansion of Moody's Analytics (MA) solutions. MA's significant recurring revenue growth reflects customer demand for risk assessment products, particularly in KYC and financial crime compliance, insurance, and asset management. The company has also integrated ESG considerations into its credit ratings and expanded its offerings to support insurers and asset managers in managing ESG risks. Despite a decline in overall issuance compared to the prior year, favorable issuance mix contributed to an increase in transactional MIS revenue. Moody's has revised its 2021 guidance upward, forecasting revenue growth in the low double-digit percent range and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $11.55 to $11.85. This revised guidance reflects the ongoing demand for Moody's risk assessment offerings and the company's focus on cost efficiency and reinvesting in growth.
