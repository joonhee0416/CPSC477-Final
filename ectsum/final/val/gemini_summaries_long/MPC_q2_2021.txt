During the second quarter, Marathon Petroleum Corporation experienced a gradual increase in demand for its products. Despite a 2-5% decrease in gasoline demand compared to 2019 levels and a 30% decline in jet fuel demand, diesel demand remained stable. The company is cautiously optimistic about the second half of the year and will focus on factors within its control. Strategic priorities included the sale of the Speedway business, progressing the conversion of the Martinez refinery to a renewable diesel facility, and maintaining cost discipline. Financially, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $2.194 billion, driven by higher refining margins and increased utilization. The company generated $1.535 billion in cash from continuing operations and returned $1.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. To further strengthen its competitive position, Marathon Petroleum Corporation will initiate an open-market repurchase program to complete the remaining $9 billion capital return over the next 12 to 16 months. The company remains committed to cost reductions, with its refining operating cost averaging $5 per barrel in 2021. Furthermore, Marathon Petroleum Corporation is making strides in sustainability, including a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and a 20% reduction in fresh water withdrawal by 2030. The company is also investing in renewable fuels, allocating 40% of its growth capital to develop renewable diesel projects.
