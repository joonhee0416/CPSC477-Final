First American delivered exceptional financial results in Q3, with strong performance across core businesses and strategic initiatives. The launch of Endpoint, a digital closing platform, captured 3% market share in its initial Seattle market and expanded to 11 additional locations. Endpoint's commitment to tech talent, innovation, and continuous improvement has made it a preferred choice for PropTech companies. The acquisition of ServiceMac will complement First American's title and closing operations. Venture investments generated $278 million of gains, primarily driven by the success of PropTech companies like OfferPad. The company's strong financial position includes a dividend increase of 11% and a share repurchase authorization of $300 million. Looking ahead, the real estate market remains healthy despite expected moderation in home price appreciation. Purchase volumes are projected to grow, and the commercial business continues to experience robust activity. Refinancing volume is expected to decline with rising mortgage rates, but increased investment income is likely to offset this.
