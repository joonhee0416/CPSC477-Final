Dynex delivered an impressive 15.2% total economic return in 2020 despite market volatility, due to active portfolio and risk management. The company's book value increased significantly, and it maintained its commitment to solid dividend payments. With a focus on risk management and disciplined capital allocation, Dynex has consistently outperformed industry benchmarks over one-, three-, and five-year periods. Despite the challenges of 2020, Dynex believes the current investment environment remains favorable, with anchored financing costs and the potential for widening net interest spreads as the yield curve steepens. The strong liquidity position, along with the team's experience and skill, positions Dynex to capitalize on future opportunities and deliver value to shareholders in the range of 10% to 12%, with the potential for mid-teens returns if spreads widen.
