CVS Health has exceeded expectations with double-digit revenue growth for the third consecutive quarter. Adjusted earnings per share guidance has been raised to $7.90-$8.00. This positive performance is driven by strong growth in healthcare benefits and retail segments. Membership gains in healthcare benefits and pharmacy services, along with increased retail volume, have contributed to the company's success. CVS Health has also expanded its integrated healthcare experience, offering virtual care and health management programs. The company has added over 1.3 million integrated pharmacy and medical members, reflecting the growing demand for comprehensive health solutions. Additionally, the strong performance of the pharmacy services segment has been supported by continued growth in specialty pharmacy, driving revenue growth of 9.3%. The retail segment also outperformed expectations with 10% revenue growth, largely due to the administration of COVID-19 vaccines and core pharmacy services. CVS Health remains committed to addressing the total cost of care, expanding its role in care delivery, and investing in digital services to enhance consumer experience.
