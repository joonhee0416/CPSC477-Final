Group One Automotive reported strong first-quarter results despite the impact of the February winter weather event in Texas and ongoing COVID-19 restrictions in the UK. Adjusted net income soared by 236% year-over-year to $103 million, driven by robust new and used vehicle sales in the US. Same-store new and used unit sales in the US grew by 11% and 5%, respectively, surpassing industry benchmarks. Despite tight inventory levels, record-breaking monthly used vehicle sales and higher margins contributed to the company's strong revenue. Additionally, the company's cost discipline, including increased salesperson productivity and a leaner cost structure, further supported profitability. Acceleride, the company's digital retailing platform, continues to gain momentum, with a record 4,000 vehicles sold and ongoing enhancements. Despite the challenging economic environment, Group One Automotive's financial position remains robust, with ample liquidity and a focus on strategic acquisitions to drive future growth.
