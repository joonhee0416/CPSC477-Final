Graham Corporation experienced a challenging third quarter, reporting a loss per share of $0.35. Navy project cost overruns in the Batavia operations, due to labor and material shortages and first article challenges, significantly impacted performance. Despite the loss, revenue increased to $28.8 million, with defense representing 58% of sales. Barber-Nichols, acquired in June, contributed $12 million and is exceeding expectations, boosting overall sales. However, the company suspended its dividend due to covenant breaches related to debt-to-EBITDA and fixed cost charges, and is in negotiations to amend its bank agreement. The backlog remains strong at $272.6 million, with defense representing 77%, and Graham Corporation remains committed to its strategic pivot towards defense. The company's restructuring and focus on operational effectiveness and aftermarket opportunities are expected to drive future growth and profitability.
