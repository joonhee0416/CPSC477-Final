Applied Industrial Technologies recorded a 13.4% organic sales decline in Q1, an improvement from -18.4% last quarter, with signs of recovery visible. Maintenance activity and break/fix requirements are increasing as customers return to facilities and utilize equipment more, leading to sequential growth in sales rates. While heavy industries remain weak, verticals like Food & Beverage, Technology, and Chemicals saw positive momentum. Despite limited visibility, Applied Industrial Technologies expects Q2 organic sales to decline by 13-14%, with potential for better or worse performance depending on underlying industrial activity and internal growth initiatives. Gross margin improved sequentially, and cost control measures resulted in a 9.5% decremental margin, exceeding expectations. Cash flow was strong, with $78.2 million in free cash flow, and net debt reduced by nearly 30% over the past year. The company continues to focus on internal growth initiatives and is pursuing strategic M&A in automation and fluid power. Long-term targets include reaching $4.5 billion in sales and 11% EBITDA margins.
