Martin Marietta Materials set record financial and safety performance in 2020 despite COVID-19 disruptions. Consolidated total revenues grew 7% to $4.4 billion, with adjusted EBITDA increasing 11% to $1.4 billion and diluted earnings per share rising 18% to $11.54. Solid shipment and pricing growth fueled this performance, particularly in residential construction, aggregates, and cement. The company expects a return to normalcy in 2021, with aggregates shipment growth projected between 1% and 4% and pricing increases of up to 5%. Favorable trends in e-commerce, remote work, and single-family housing are expected to drive construction activity and support Martin Marietta's long-term growth. The company's strong cash generation, disciplined capital allocation, and solid balance sheet provide flexibility for investments and value creation.
