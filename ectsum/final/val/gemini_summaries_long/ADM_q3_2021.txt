In Q3 2021, ADM reported substantial growth across segments. Adjusted segment operating profit increased 18% to $1 billion, leading to a record $4.6 billion in trailing EBITDA and a 9.6% adjusted ROIC. The company's portfolio management strategy focuses on growing nutrition (with acquisitions like WILD and Sojaprotein), evolving Carbohydrate Solutions (through investments in biosolutions, ethanol-to-SAF conversion, and dry mill transitions), and leveraging the strength of Ag Services. Nutrition continues to drive growth with 17% higher revenues and 15% profit growth. The Human Nutrition team saw strong results in flavors and beverages, while Animal Nutrition benefited from alternative protein demand and mineral assets. The company anticipates continued momentum in Q4 and a strong 2022, with robust global demand and a focus on meeting trends in food security, health and well-being, and sustainability.
