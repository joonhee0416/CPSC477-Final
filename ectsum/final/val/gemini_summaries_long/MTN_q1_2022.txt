Vail Resorts' strong pass sales indicate a 47% increase in units and 21% in sales compared to last year, with a 76% increase in units and 45% increase in sales compared to pre-pandemic levels in 2019. The company anticipates exceeding 2.1 million guests with advanced commitment products this year, a significant increase from previous seasons. Despite challenging early season conditions leading to delayed openings, the company's strong pass sales provide stability for the business. Vail Resorts remains focused on improving the guest experience with investments in new lifts, expanded terrain, and technology enhancements. The company is also prioritizing the on-mountain experience of pass holders, limiting lift ticket sales during peak periods, and implementing a daily forecast of lift line wait times. Vail Resorts reported a net loss of $139.3 million for Q1 2022, compared to a net loss of $153.8 million in Q1 2021. The company's strong liquidity position and free cash flow generation support its disciplined approach to capital allocation, including the planned $315 million to $325 million capital investment plan for 2022. Vail Resorts has also announced plans to acquire Seven Springs Mountain Resort, Hidden Valley Ski Resort, and Laurel Mountain ski area, which is expected to close this winter and generate over $15 million in incremental annual EBITDA.
