Conagra reported strong fiscal 2021 results, driven by consumer demand during the pandemic, despite recent inflationary challenges. For fiscal 2022, guidance has been revised due to higher-than-anticipated inflation. Organic net sales growth is expected to remain flat compared to 2021, while adjusted operating margin is estimated at approximately 16%. Adjusted earnings per share are now projected to be $2.50, with second-half earnings expected to be in line with previous estimates. The company has taken aggressive measures to combat inflation, including pricing adjustments and productivity initiatives, which are anticipated to fully offset cost increases in the latter half of the year. Despite the guidance revision, Conagra remains confident in its long-term growth prospects, emphasizing its brand strength, innovation pipeline, and plans for continued investment.
