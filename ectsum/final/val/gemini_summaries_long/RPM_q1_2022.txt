In Q1 of fiscal 2022, RPM International reported a 2.7% increase in sales to $1.65 billion, driven by growth in the Construction Products Group (15%), Performance Coatings Group, and Specialty Products Group. However, adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased 25% due to supply chain challenges and inflation. Despite these challenges, all three growing segments saw solid sales and adjusted EBIT growth, offsetting an organic sales decline of 1%. RPM is making strategic investments in acquisitions and manufacturing facilities to strengthen its position and capitalize on market opportunities, such as the increasing need for infrastructure investment and the growth of holistic connected building envelopes. To navigate ongoing raw material shortages and inflation, the company is implementing price increases and benefiting from cost savings from its Map to Growth program. Looking ahead to Q2 of fiscal 2022, RPM anticipates mid-single-digit consolidated sales growth with double-digit growth in the Construction Products Group, Performance Coatings Group, and Specialty Products Group. However, the Consumer Group is expected to experience a double-digit sales decrease due to supply chain issues and a tough comparison to the prior year's pandemic-driven demand. Overall, RPM remains well-positioned to meet industry trends and capitalize on growth opportunities while addressing supply chain and inflationary pressures.
