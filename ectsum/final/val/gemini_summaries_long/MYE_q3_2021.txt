Myers Industries reported strong growth in the third quarter, continuing a recent trend. Net sales increased by 20% organically, driven by price (13%) and volume mix (7%). The company completed two acquisitions (Elkhart and Trilogy) during the quarter, contributing to a 51% increase in overall net sales. However, inflationary pressures and labor shortages impacted margins, resulting in lower adjusted gross profit and operating income. Despite these headwinds, Myers reaffirmed its 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $0.90 to $1.05, supported by additional pricing actions, improved sales force, and strategic initiatives aimed at mitigating external challenges. The company remains confident in its long-term growth strategy and recently held a management retreat to align on strategic goals and objectives.
