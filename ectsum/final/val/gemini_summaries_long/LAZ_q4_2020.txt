Lazard reported a significant financial performance in both Financial Advisory and Asset Management. Financial Advisory had a record quarter with increased M&A activity amidst a decreasing market volume, driven by strong performance in the US, Europe, and restructuring. Asset Management experienced a 12% revenue growth and a 9% AUM increase from Q3 2020, benefiting from higher management fees, AUM growth, and strong performance in alternative strategies. Despite net outflows in value strategies, platforms like global and quantitative equities witnessed net inflows. Lazard continues to invest in growth, with plans to capitalize on favorable market conditions. The company sees opportunities in both Financial Advisory and Asset Management and is investing to enhance its competitive edge. Overall, Lazard's diversified business model, global platform, and client-focused approach have contributed to its strong financial performance.
