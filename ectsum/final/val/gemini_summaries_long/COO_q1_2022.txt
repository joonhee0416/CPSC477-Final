CooperVision posted strong Q1 results, driven by daily silicone hydrogel and myopia management portfolios. MiSight myopia control revenue soared 172%, and the launch of MyDay multifocal has been well-received. CooperSurgical saw 30% growth in revenue, with fertility and Generate Life Sciences contributing significantly. The integration of Generate is proceeding smoothly, with revenue recognition of $34 million. Overall, consolidated revenues reached $787 million, a 16% increase, with non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.24. Despite the impact of currency headwinds and increased expenses, the company expects fiscal 2022 non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $13.70 to $14.20. Cooper is also set to acquire Cook Medical's reproductive health business, expected to contribute to future growth. With a robust product portfolio, ongoing product launches, and momentum in myopia management, Cooper remains optimistic about its prospects.
