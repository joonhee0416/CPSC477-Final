Despite macroeconomic challenges, Newpark Resources saw a $152 million revenue increase, up 7% sequentially. Their Fluid Systems revenue grew 11%, driven by improvements in Canada, the Asia Pacific region, and international markets. Industrial Solutions continued its solid performance, with Site and Access Solutions generating $42 million in revenue, boosted by expanding customer presence in utilities. Site access revenue growth in the power transmission and other industrial markets is on pace to nearly reach $150 million for 2021, indicating progress in the company's strategic focus. While U.S. Fluid revenues remained stable, revenues in the Gulf of Mexico declined due to weather-related impacts. International revenues showed a 6% increase, aided by growth in the Asia Pacific region. North America land revenues nearly doubled year-over-year, reflecting market rig count improvements, while Gulf of Mexico revenues decreased slightly. International revenues also grew year-over-year, benefiting from new project start-ups and customer activity recovery in Europe and Algeria. Despite progress in returning the Fluid Systems segment to profitability, a $4 million charge related to Hurricane Ida and ongoing cost actions kept the reported operating loss flat sequentially. Newpark remains optimistic about the long-term fundamentals across major energy sectors, expects strong rental projects and product sales in the fourth quarter for their Industrial Solutions segment, and anticipates a mid-single-digit percentage revenue growth in their Fluid Systems segment for Q4.
