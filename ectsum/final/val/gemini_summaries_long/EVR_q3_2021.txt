Evercore's third quarter results showcased exceptional performance, driven by a strong M&A and capital raising environment. The company achieved record revenues and earnings, with Advisory fees reaching $709 million, an increase of 161% year-over-year. Underwriting fees declined slightly but remained stable compared to the prior year. Commissions and related revenue grew 6% as the firm continued to benefit from check collections and convertible securities trading. The firm's strength in advisory is evident with its ranking as the number 1 independent firm for dollar volume of announced M&A globally and among the top 7 firms overall. Evercore's ongoing strategic initiatives to broaden and diversify its platform are paying off, and the company remains optimistic about its growth prospects. The firm plans to continue investing in talent acquisition and product capabilities to further enhance its advisory services. Evercore's capital return strategy emphasizes returning all earnings not invested in the business to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. With a strong backlog and momentum in its business, Evercore expects to achieve another record year in revenues and earnings for 2021.
