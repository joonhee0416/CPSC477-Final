New Jersey Resources delivered a strong first quarter with net financial earnings (NFE) of $0.46 per share, driven by the performance of New Jersey Natural Gas. The company reaffirmed its NFE guidance for fiscal 2021 of $1.55 to $1.65 per share and increased its fiscal 2022 NFE guidance to $2.20 to $2.30 per share, an increase of $0.15 per share from prior guidance. Key milestones include the near completion of the Southern Reliability Link, approval for a $150 million infrastructure investment program, and the acquisition of a 2.9-megawatt solar facility. Additionally, New Jersey Resources entered into asset management agreements (AMAs) with an investment-grade utility, resulting in $501 million in contracted cash proceeds over 10 years, which will significantly improve the predictability of earnings and cash flows and reduce operational risks in its Energy Services business. The company expects strong cash flow growth and improved credit metrics, allowing them to cash settle their equity forward and eliminate future block equity needs.
