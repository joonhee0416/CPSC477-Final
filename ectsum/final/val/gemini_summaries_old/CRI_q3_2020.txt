Carter's is recovering well from the pandemic-related market disruption. They saw record gross profit margins due to improved price realization and fewer promotions, reduced spending and inventory below prior year levels, and strengthened cash flow and liquidity. Business trends are positive, with strong sales in July (90% of prior year sales), particularly in the final week before the 4th of July holiday (comped up 7%). Sales dipped slightly in August due to delayed school openings, but rebounded in September, reaching 95% of prior year sales (highest performance since the pandemic began). Labor Day sales were also strong, with comparable retail sales up 15%. Demand for baby apparel and sleepwear remains high (70% of total apparel sales), and playwear sales improved in September as families prepared for cooler weather. The Little Baby Basics product launch was a success, with replenishment trends exceeding last year. Retail sales improved to 97% of Q3 last year, outperforming wholesale and international segments. The shift to online purchases has accelerated, leading to reduced store hours and increased online demand. However, store traffic remains lower, while conversion rates and units purchased per transaction are higher. The majority of store closures have occurred in declining centers, but Carter's is actively pursuing opportunities in better centers that provide high-return on investment. Wholesale sales also showed progress, with growth in online demand and exclusive brands, although Carter's brand sales were down due to cautious retailer planning and lower inventory commitments. International sales were 90% of last year's sales, with strength in direct-to-consumer business. The supply chain has improved, with inventories down over 10% compared to last year and lower product costs expected for spring 2021. The company is also managing exposure to freight surcharges and expects minimal impact on fourth-quarter earnings. Overall, Carter's is confident in its strong product offerings and marketing plans as it navigates the pandemic-related challenges.
