Everest Reinsurance Group continued its growth trajectory in Q3 2020, buoyed by improved rate levels and high retention rates.

Everest's strong underwriting performance saw an improved attritional combined ratio of 85.8% after accounting for $300 million in catastrophe losses. While the pandemic has had an impact, Everest has proactively added $125 million to its COVID-19 loss provision, reflecting the ongoing nature of the event and their prudent reserving philosophy. The company's financial strength has been further solidified with a successful $1 billion senior notes offering at a low 3.5% coupon. Everest's management remains optimistic about the future, citing favorable market conditions and their talented team as assets to capitalize on growth opportunities.
