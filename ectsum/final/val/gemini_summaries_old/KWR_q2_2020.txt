In the second quarter of 2020, Quaker Houghton reported a 27% decline in pro forma sales due to the impact of COVID-19, with a 30% decline in Metalworking customer industry groups reflecting prolonged shutdowns and production reductions. However, the company gained 2% in organic sales through net share gains. Despite lower volumes, product margins increased by approximately 2% due to raw material synergies. Quaker Houghton implemented cost-saving measures, achieving $12 million in synergy savings during the quarter and increasing the full-year synergy guidance to $53 million. The company's cash flow doubled year-to-date to $44.7 million due to improved working capital management. Looking ahead, Quaker Houghton anticipates gradual sequential improvement in performance throughout the second half of the year, with improvement in volumes expected to positively impact gross margins. The company remains confident in its ability to weather the current economic challenges and leverage future upswings in business activity.
