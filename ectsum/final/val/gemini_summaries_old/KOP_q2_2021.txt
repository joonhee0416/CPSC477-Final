In Q2 2021, Koppers' consolidated sales rose to $441 million, driven by increases in PC and CM&C segments. Adjusted EBITDA improved to $66 million, primarily due to higher profits in PC and CM&C.

PC benefited from international sales and copper-based preservative price increases, while CM&C saw higher demand and favorable pricing for certain products. RUPS experienced a decline in crosstie treating volumes and customer deferrals.

Despite macroeconomic challenges, Koppers remains cautiously optimistic about the remainder of 2021. PC expects demand to recover as lumber prices moderate, and international markets continue to perform well. RUPS anticipates gradual improvement as crosstie demand increases. CM&C projects strong demand and favorable pricing to sustain growth.

Overall, Koppers' 2021 sales forecast remains in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion, with EBITDA projections unchanged at $220 million to $230 million. Adjusted earnings per share guidance is also steady at $4.35 to $4.60.

Koppers continues to invest in growth and productivity, with capital expenditures expected to reach $80 million to $90 million. The company is optimistic about its long-term growth prospects, aiming for $300 million in EBITDA generation by 2025.
