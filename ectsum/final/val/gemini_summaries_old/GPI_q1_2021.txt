Group 1 Automotive reported a strong first quarter, generating adjusted net income of $103 million, a significant increase over the prior year and pre-pandemic levels. This growth was driven by various factors, including strong new and used vehicle sales in the U.S., a surge in aftersales revenue, and continued cost discipline. Despite challenges related to COVID-19, the company remains optimistic, with consumer demand for vehicles remaining strong and aftersales revenue expected to improve in the coming months. The company's financial position remains solid, with record liquidity and ample flexibility for capital deployment through acquisitions. Group 1's continued focus on digital retailing, with its Acceleride platform, and its commitment to growth through strategic acquisitions further enhance its long-term prospects.
