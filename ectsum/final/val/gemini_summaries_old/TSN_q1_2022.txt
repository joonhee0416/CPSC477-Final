Tyson Foods reported strong financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2022, with double-digit sales and earnings growth. The company achieved this growth through ongoing demand strength, productivity savings, and improved execution across its segments. Despite labor challenges, Tyson Foods' total company volumes improved slightly, with chicken volume growing 3.6%. The company remains committed to improving its volume performance by investing in its team members, additional capacity, and brands and product innovation.

Higher costs across the supply chain, including feed, ingredients, and labor, led to an 18% increase in cost of goods sold. However, Tyson Foods implemented price increases to mitigate the impact of inflation, resulting in a 19.6% increase in average sales price.

Tyson Foods' operating income increased by 40% during the quarter, driven by strong performance in its beef, pork, and chicken segments. The company expects to continue growing its total company volumes by 2% to 3% in fiscal 2022, outpacing protein consumption growth.

The company also announced progress on its productivity program, expecting to deliver $300 million to $400 million of savings in fiscal 2022. Tyson Foods remains focused on executing its five key imperatives to drive growth and value creation: winning with team members, customers, and consumers; enhancing its portfolio and capacity; restoring competitiveness in its chicken segment; driving operational and functional excellence; and investing in new capacity and automation.
