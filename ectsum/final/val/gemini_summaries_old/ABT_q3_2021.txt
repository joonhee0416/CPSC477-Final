Abbott reported a strong third quarter with ongoing earnings per share growth of 45% and organic sales growth of 22%. Excluding COVID testing-related sales, organic sales increased 12%, driven by strength in nutritionals, established pharmaceuticals, and diabetes care. Nutrition sales grew 9%, led by strong performance in pediatric and adult nutrition. Established pharmaceuticals sales increased 15%, with broad-based growth across several countries. Medical devices sales grew 13%, fueled by double-digit growth in Rhythm Management, Structural Heart, Heart Failure, and Diabetes Care. Diabetes Care saw strong sales of FreeStyle Libre, with over 200,000 new users added, bringing the total global user base to over 3.5 million. Abbott maintains its leadership position in COVID testing, with a supply capacity of over 100 million tests per month and expects $1 billion to $1.4 billion in COVID testing-related sales in the fourth quarter. The company raised its full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $5 to $5.10, reflecting nearly 40% growth compared to last year.
