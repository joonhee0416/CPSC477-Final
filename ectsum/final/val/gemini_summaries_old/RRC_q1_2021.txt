Range Resources' first quarter results demonstrate significant progress toward its strategic objectives. The company's operational efficiency drove lower unit costs in G&A, LOE, exploration expense, and production taxes, exceeding expectations. Moreover, realized NGL prices reached $26.35 per barrel pre-hedge, a 77% increase year-over-year, contributing to a significant premium over Henry Hub prices. Range also reported strong free cash flow of $193 million, driven by improved pricing and efficient operations.

Capital spending was prudent at $105 million, and the company remains on track to deliver its full-year capital budget of $425 million. Range's drilling and completion activities were highly effective, with near-record efficiency levels and reduced costs due to water recycling and electric fracturing. The company has a large inventory of high-quality wells, with over 2,000 Marcellus locations having EURs greater than 2 Bcfe per 1,000 feet of lateral.

Range's marketing efforts resulted in strong NGL and condensate pricing. Propane prices led the way, increasing 60% compared to the prior quarter, while Range achieved record premiums for its NGL sales. The company also optimized its condensate sales portfolio, which further enhances its liquids area development plan.

On the natural gas side, Range expects continued positive pricing dynamics, supported by operators targeting maintenance production levels and year-over-year storage improvements. The company is also implementing targeted hedging strategies to balance cash flow protection with market upside exposure.

Range's focus on environmental and safety performance continues. The company achieved a 30% improvement in recordable incidents during the quarter and reduced its emissions through increased leak detection and the use of an electric frac fleet. Range's environmental performance is competitive with any natural gas play in North America.

Overall, Range Resources' first quarter results reflect strong execution, operational efficiency, and prudent capital allocation. The company's low unit costs, margin improvements, and strong free cash flow generation position it well to benefit from improving industry fundamentals and deliver sustainable returns to shareholders.
