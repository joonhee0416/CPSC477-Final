Range reported strong first quarter results, exceeding expectations and demonstrating progress toward strategic objectives. Key highlights include improved margins due to higher unit prices, particularly for NGLs, leading to significant free cash flow generation. Unit costs were well-controlled, with lease operating expenses declining by over 40% year-over-year. The company's operational efficiency initiatives, including long lateral development and reduced drilling and completion costs, have resulted in a capital-efficient development plan. Range's marketing strategy has benefited from strong NGL and condensate prices, with the company achieving a premium to Mont Belvieu prices due to its diversified portfolio and international sales contracts. Range's balance sheet has been strengthened with reduced debt maturities and improved liquidity, and the company is targeting a leverage ratio of 1.5 times debt to EBITDA by the end of 2022. The long-term prospects for Range are positive, given its large portfolio of quality inventory, low breakeven costs, and a focus on sustainable free cash flow generation.
