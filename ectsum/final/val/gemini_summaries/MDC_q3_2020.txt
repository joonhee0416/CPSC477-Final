M.D.C. Holdings achieved a strong Q3, with a 33% increase in home sales revenue, a 370 basis point expansion in homebuilding operating margin, and a 96% growth in net income. The company's net new order growth surged by 73% with a sales pace of 6.1 homes per community per month. This growth is attributed to increased homebuyer demand for new homes due to existing inventory shortage (down 19% from last year) and peace of mind associated with new construction. The company's strategic focus on affordable products aligns well with demographic shifts and demand for value-driven homes. MDC has a deep bench of talent, with several key leadership promotions and the appointment of David Mandarich as President and CEO. The company ended Q3 with 194 active subdivisions, with an anticipated decrease to 185 by year-end. Despite the expected seasonal slowdown, October net orders are projected to surpass 2019 orders by at least 50%. The estimated sales value for homes in backlog stands at $3.1 billion, a 47% year-over-year increase. Lot acquisitions rose by 63%, and total lot supply increased by 8% compared to the previous year. MDC anticipates continued growth in the future and has set a preliminary target of 10,000 home deliveries for 2021. The Board of Directors declared a 21% increase in quarterly cash dividend to $0.40 per share, marking a 33% increase from the previous year.
