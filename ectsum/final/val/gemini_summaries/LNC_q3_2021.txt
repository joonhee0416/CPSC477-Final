Despite ongoing challenges in the life insurance and group protection segments due to the pandemic, Lincoln Financial's underlying earnings power remains strong, driving the company's confidence in its ability to achieve its 8-10% earnings per share growth target. The annuities business reported a 7% increase in sales, while retirement plan services delivered another quarter of excellent results, driven by digital innovation and expanding product solutions. Sales momentum is reemerging across all business lines, supported by distribution strength and product innovation. Lincoln also initiated the "Spark" cost savings initiative, expected to generate $260-300 million in annual savings by 2024. The recent block sale generated $1.2 billion in capital, $900 million of which is earmarked for share repurchases, further boosting earnings per share. Overall, Lincoln's strong product portfolio, distribution channels, ongoing expense management, and capital management initiatives position the company for continued growth in the coming quarters.
