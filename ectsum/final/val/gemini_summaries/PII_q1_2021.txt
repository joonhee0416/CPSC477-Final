Despite significant supply chain challenges, Polaris delivered strong first-quarter results, beating expectations. Retail sales surged 70% in North America, driven by increased consumer interest and a surge in new customers. The company's ORV, Snowmobile, and Motorcycle segments gained market share, while international sales increased 59%. Polaris faced elevated costs from logistics, commodities, and rework but offset them partially with price increases and lower promotional costs. The company raised its full-year guidance, now expecting sales growth of 18-21% and adjusted earnings per share of $9.00-$9.25. However, gross profit margins are expected to decline due to negative product mix, increased logistics costs, and higher commodity prices. Supply chain constraints are expected to persist, but the company's ongoing efforts to optimize its supply chain and increase capacity should help meet demand in the long term.
