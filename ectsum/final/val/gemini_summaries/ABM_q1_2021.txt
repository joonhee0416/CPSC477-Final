Despite a 7.5% revenue decline due to the pandemic, ABM experienced strong earnings growth in Q1. This growth is attributed to increased demand for higher-margin Work Orders and EnhancedClean services, particularly in Business & Industry and Technology & Manufacturing segments. On a GAAP basis, earnings per share surged to $1.10 from $0.41 last year, and on an adjusted basis, earnings rose over 160% to $1.01 per share. This improvement was also driven by effective labor management, resulting in a 400-basis point increase in adjusted EBITDA margins to 8.3%. ABM anticipates a return to growth in the second half of 2021, with continued demand for high-margin services and labor arbitrage retention. Despite a modest 50% current travel volume in Aviation, the company remains optimistic about the sector's recovery as vaccine rollouts progress. ABM's full-year guidance ranges from $2.85 to $3.10 per share on a GAAP basis and $3.00 to $3.25 per share on an adjusted basis, reflecting the company's strong liquidity and leverage and its commitment to strategic growth.
