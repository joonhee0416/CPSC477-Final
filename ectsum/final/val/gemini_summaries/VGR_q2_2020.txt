Vector Group experienced mixed results in Q2, with revenue increases in the tobacco segment but significant declines in the real estate segment due to COVID-19 and unusual prior-year comparisons. The tobacco segment reported increased unit volumes and higher net pricing, leading to higher earnings. Liggett's revenue and earnings grew compared to the previous year, with retail shipments increasing by 0.2%. EAGLE 20's, the third-largest discount brand in the US, saw strong growth in retail volume. Despite competitive pressures from smaller deep discount-focused companies, Liggett maintains a strong market position due to its broad distribution, promotional programs, and sales force capabilities. Vector Group's liquidity increased by $53 million, and the company remains financially strong with plans for strategic investments.
