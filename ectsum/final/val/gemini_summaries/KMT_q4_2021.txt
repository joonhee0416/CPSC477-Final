Despite COVID-19 challenges, Kennametal ended fiscal year 2021 with positive momentum. Its simplification/modernization program resulted in $186 million in savings, enabling strong operating leverage and growth in areas such as aerospace, general engineering, and renewable energy.

Kennametal is leveraging its modernized footprint to drive growth and higher profitability, aiming to achieve its adjusted EBITDA target of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion in sales. The company's strategic initiatives, including growth in its fit-for-purpose products offering, are expected to contribute to its success in fiscal year 2022.
