In the first quarter, PCA reported net income of $143 million, excluding special items, resulting in earnings per share of $1.50, below the $1.98 per share in the same period last year. Despite challenges such as lower prices and reduced volumes, the company benefited from higher volumes in Packaging, lower costs, and higher nonoperating pension expense. While the Packaging segment experienced a higher demand surge in the first and second quarters, PCA anticipates a normalization of growth trends and potential impact from health measures on operations. However, with essential products for the pandemic response, the company remains positive about long-term demand as the global economy recovers. Despite the uncertainty, PCA maintains financial strength and liquidity to navigate the crisis while prioritizing the safety of its employees and supporting its customers and suppliers.
