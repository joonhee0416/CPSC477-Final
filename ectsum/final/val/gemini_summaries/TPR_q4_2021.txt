Tapestry, Inc. achieved standout results in fiscal 2021, driven by its Acceleration Program and strategic initiatives. Key highlights include a significant increase in digital penetration to 30%, reaching $1.6 billion in revenue and surpassing pre-pandemic levels. The company's sales exceeded pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter, with Coach outperforming and exceeding expectations by 2%. Additionally, Tapestry recorded record operating margin, operating income, and earnings per share growth compared to both FY'20 and FY'19 in each quarter of the fiscal year. This success was attributed to gross margin expansion, SG&A leverage, and strategic actions. Tapestry generated $1.2 billion in free cash flow and ended the year with a strong cash position, reducing its leverage through organic profit growth and debt repayment. Given their strong financial position and business trends, Tapestry's board approved a capital return program, aiming to return over $750 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The company's outlook for fiscal 2022 projects mid-teens revenue growth, sustained strong gross margins, and operating income growth in the mid-teens range.
