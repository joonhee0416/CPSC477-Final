Barnes Group reported impressive first-quarter results with organic sales down 10% year-over-year, primarily due to lower Aerospace volumes. However, strong Industrial segment growth (high single-digit organic growth) and better-than-expected earnings (EPS $0.38) boosted confidence. Orders surged across all segments, with Industrial (25%), Molding Solutions (35%), and Force & Motion Control (low double-digits) experiencing significant increases. The year's outlook has been revised upward, with organic sales growth now projected at 10-12%, reflecting stronger industrial performance. EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.78 to $1.98, representing a 9-21% increase. Despite supply-related challenges and inflationary pressures, the company remains committed to growth-driving investments. The Aerospace segment continues to experience challenges, with sales down 38% and operating profit down 65%, but the backlog remains strong. With a manageable leverage ratio (3.1 times) and adequate liquidity, the company plans to resume share repurchases to offset equity dilution.
