SJW Group reported a first-quarter net income of $2.6 million, a slight increase from the same period last year. Despite facing challenges due to reduced customer usage and water supply constraints in California, the company's revenue grew by 1% to $114.8 million. This growth was driven by rate increases, cost savings, and non-regulated income. However, the company anticipates increased operating costs in 2021 due to reliance on purchased water due to California's low rainfall and snowpack. Consequently, SJW Group adjusted its earnings guidance to $1.85 to $2.05 per diluted share for the year, assuming no additional company-produced surface water in California. The company invested $46.7 million in capital expenditures and is committed to investing in water systems to provide safe and reliable water service. Additionally, SJW Group has executed a credit agreement and issued new shares to repay outstanding balances and support general corporate purposes. The company also saw successful developments in its Texas operations, acquiring the Clear Water Estates Water System. SJW Group remains optimistic about its future prospects and is committed to its diversity, equity, inclusion, and environmental initiatives.
