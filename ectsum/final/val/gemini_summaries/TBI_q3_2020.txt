In the third quarter, the company posted a resilient revenue of $475 million, a 25% decline year-over-year. Despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, the company returned to profitability with a net income of $9 million ($0.25 per share). This marks a significant improvement from the losses incurred in the second quarter. The company attributed this return to profitability to steady revenue improvements across most industries and geographies, as well as ongoing cost management initiatives. PeopleReady, the largest segment, saw a 29% revenue decline but benefited from intra-quarter improvement, with revenue down 27% in September compared to 32% in July. PeopleManagement, the second-largest segment, performed well with an 8% revenue decline and a 35% increase in segment profit, driven by cost management actions and favorable prior-year comparisons. PeopleScout, the smallest segment, experienced a 48% revenue decline due to its exposure to travel and leisure clients. Notably, the company is investing in its digital strategy, particularly in its JobStack mobile app, which is driving higher digital fill rates and operational efficiencies. The company also highlighted its strong balance sheet and expects to renew its focus on returning excess capital to shareholders as the economy recovers.
