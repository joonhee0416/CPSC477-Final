Church & Dwight's Q1 earnings exceeded expectations with reported sales growth of 6.3%, yielding adjusted earnings per share of $0.83. Organic sales increased by 4.9%, driven by higher consumption, particularly in health and wellness categories such as gummy vitamins and dental care products. E-commerce sales surged by 54%, accounting for 14.8% of total sales. Despite raw material shortages caused by the Texas freeze leading to higher input costs, the company has implemented price increases, reduced promotions, and increased productivity to offset these challenges. Notably, international markets outside the U.S. continue to experience lockdown measures, impacting consumer mobility. Overall, the company raised its full-year sales growth outlook to 5%-6% and organic sales growth outlook to 4%-5%, while flat gross margin and an effective tax rate of 22% are projected. Adjusted earnings per share are anticipated to range from $3.03 to $3.06, representing a 6%-8% annual increase.
