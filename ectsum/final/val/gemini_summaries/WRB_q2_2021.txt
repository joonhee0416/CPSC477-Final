The company reported another record quarter with impressive growth in premium and expansion in underwriting profits, resulting in an ROE of 15%. Gross premiums written increased by 24.8% to $2.7 billion, driven by rate improvements and growth in exposure across all lines of business. Underwriting income soared by 800% to $202 million, benefiting from an 8.5% growth in net premiums earned and favorable loss ratios. Net investment income surged by 96.9% to $168 million, largely due to strong performance in investment funds. The combined ratio excluding catastrophes improved from 90.2% to 87.5%, reflecting the company's strong underwriting performance. Notably, the company is prioritizing exposure growth amidst attractive margins, while still securing rate increases that outpace loss trends in most product lines. Expense ratio improved to 28.7%, driven by growth in earned premium, partially offset by rising expenses as the economy reopens. The company maintains a strong balance sheet with ample cash and high credit quality. Management expressed optimism about future prospects, emphasizing the favorable macro conditions and the company's earnings potential for the coming years.
