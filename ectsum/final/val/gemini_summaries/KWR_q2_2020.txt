Despite the challenges presented by COVID-19, Quaker Houghton maintained operations and met customer needs across all 34 plants globally. Sales declined 27% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, primarily due to impacted customer businesses. The Americas region experienced the most significant decline (35%), with the sequential sales decline being most pronounced in April, followed by a gradual improvement in May and June (20% increase). Despite the downturn, the company gained market share, with organic growth of 2%. Gross margins decreased due to lower volumes but were buoyed by approximately 2% product margin improvement. Non-GAAP operating income and earnings per share decreased significantly from the previous year and prior quarter due to the pandemic's impact. The effective tax rate was elevated at 57.9%, expected to normalize around 22%-25% for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA met guidance at $32.1 million, affirming the full-year target of more than $200 million. Liquidity and strong cash flow were positive indicators, with operating cash flow doubling year-to-date. The company has implemented cost reduction measures, realized cost synergies of $12 million, and increased its projected synergies for the year to $53 million. Quaker Houghton remains optimistic about weathering the economic downturn and leveraging future business upswings.
