Roper Industries reported exceptional second-quarter results, with revenue, EBITDA, DEPS, and cash flow all increasing over 20%. Software businesses, now representing 55% of revenue, performed remarkably, with organic growth in Application Software and NSS Software segments at 9% and 10%, respectively. Recurring revenue growth accelerated to high-singles, and perpetual license activity recovered strongly. Across product businesses, consumables revenue and capital equipment orders saw acceleration and recovery. The 2020 acquisition cohort, led by Vertafore, continues to perform well. EBITDA margins expanded by 110 basis points to 36.4%. The balance sheet remains strong, with net debt reduced by $900 million in the first half of 2021. Based on the positive momentum and improving market conditions, the company has raised its full-year DEPS guidance to $15.00-$15.20 per share, implying low double-digit organic growth in the second half. With a robust M&A pipeline, the company anticipates resuming capital deployment as its balance sheet strengthens.
