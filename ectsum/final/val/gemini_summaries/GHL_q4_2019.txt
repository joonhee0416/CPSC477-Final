Greenhill reported mixed financial results for Q4 and FY2019, with revenue exceeding expectations and earnings per share growing 20% and 133% year-over-year for the quarter but declining 14% and 68% for the year. The company's performance was driven by a strong rebound in restructuring advisory revenue, offset by a decline in Europe that overshadowed growth in other regions. Despite lower overall revenue, Greenhill achieved a respectable operating margin of 15% for the full year and net income of $0.45 per share. The company's management remains optimistic about 2020, citing a favorable outlook in M&A, restructuring advisory, and capital advisory businesses. Greenhill has also been active with share repurchases, aiming to return value to shareholders and drive further growth.
