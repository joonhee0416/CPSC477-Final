In the fourth quarter, Clearwater Paper reported strong results driven by tissue demand and paperboard performance. Net sales reached $453 million, up 4%, and adjusted EBITDA was $72 million, a 38% increase year-over-year. Tissue demand volatility persisted, surpassing expectations, with sales and production volumes exceeding the fourth quarter of 2019. Paperboard delivered strong results, aided by demand from food and healthcare packaging customers. The company announced a $50 per ton price increase for its SBS portfolio, effective February 2. In the first quarter, tissue shipments are expected to be lower than Q1 2020 levels and the fourth quarter of 2020. Paperboard will benefit from price increases in the coming quarters, while an unexpected weather outage in Arkansas is estimated to impact Q1 results by $6 million-$8 million. For the full year 2021, tissue volumes are anticipated to decline in the high single to low double digits due to normalizing consumer buying patterns. Paperboard volumes are expected to remain stable, but higher input costs are a potential headwind. Despite the challenges, Clearwater Paper expects to reduce net debt by $58 million in the fourth quarter. The company remains focused on deleveraging and exploring long-term capital allocation options to enhance shareholder value.
