Sales declined 14% to $367 million in Q2, impacted by a 1% currency translation decrease but partially offset by 2% growth from acquisitions. Net income reached $29 million ($0.17 per diluted share), with an adjustment for impairment charges resulting in net income of $62 million ($0.37 per diluted share). Gross margin rate decreased to 49.8% due to product mix shifts and lower factory volumes. Operating expenses fell by $12 million, driven by expense reductions. Despite lower revenues, cash flows from operations amounted to $143 million year-to-date. The company remains invested in growth initiatives, anticipating it will enhance future profitability. While the Contractor segment saw a rebound with low single-digit growth, the Industrial segment faced challenges and Process experienced mixed end-market trends. With uncertainties remaining, the company anticipates a challenging second half for Industrial but remains optimistic about its long-term growth strategies.
