Methode's Q3 performance shows a strong top line with an 8% increase in sales (excluding currency translation), driven by strength in Automotive, particularly EV applications. Despite headwinds from supply chain disruptions, the company generated over $80 million in free cash flow and reduced its net debt to near zero. The healthy pipeline of EV programs positions Methode for continued growth in this sector, with EV sales expected to reach the mid-teens in fiscal 2022. However, the impact of the ongoing semiconductor shortage is anticipated in Q4 and beyond, leading to a wide guidance range for revenue ($270-$300 million) and earnings per share ($0.60-$0.82). Management remains optimistic, citing strong demand and a healthy balance sheet to support future growth and potential acquisitions.
