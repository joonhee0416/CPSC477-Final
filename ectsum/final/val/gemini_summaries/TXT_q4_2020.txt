Textron's fourth quarter revenues declined by $368 million to $3.7 billion, driven by lower volumes at TRU Simulation + Training and its ground support equipment business. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $1.06 per share, a 4% decrease from $1.11 last year. Despite facing economic challenges in 2020, Textron's operating performance remained strong in the fourth quarter, with margin improvements across Systems, Industrial, and Bell. For the full year, revenues decreased to $11.7 billion from $13.6 billion, while adjusted net income fell to $2.07 per share from $3.74. However, Textron's financial outlook for 2021 is promising, with projected full-year adjusted earnings per share ranging from $2.70 to $2.90, a significant increase from the $2.07 per share reported in 2020.
