Belden's fourth quarter exceeded initial expectations, with revenues rising 5% sequentially to $498.5 million, surpassing both initial guidance and a revised estimate of $483.9 million by Refinitiv IBES. Earnings per share also climbed 25% to $0.90. Incoming order rates increased 13% sequentially, resulting in a robust book-to-bill ratio of 1.10 times. Despite ongoing inventory level reductions by channel partners, revenues increased 9.6% organically after adjustments. The Industrial Solutions segment experienced solid growth in Industrial Automation and Cybersecurity, particularly in nonrenewal bookings, while the Enterprise Solutions segment was boosted by strong demand in Broadband and 5G. The company is optimistic about its strategic initiatives, including cost reduction efforts, targeted R&D investments, and the acquisition of OTN Systems to enhance Industrial Automation offerings. For 2021, Belden anticipates revenue growth of 1%-4% organically and further earnings per share expansion, driven by these initiatives and excluding contributions from divested product lines.
