Clean Harbors achieved strong Q1 results, with adjusted EBITDA reaching $129.5 million and record adjusted free cash flow of $62.3 million. Safety remains a key priority, with a 74% reduction in total recordable incident rate since 2002. The company has made strategic changes to its Safety-Kleen organization, consolidating Environmental Services and merging sustainable lubricants businesses to enhance efficiency and profitability. Looking ahead, 2021 guidance has been raised, with adjusted EBITDA expected in the range of $560-$600 million. Environmental Services is projected to decline slightly due to COVID-19 and government assistance program impact, while Safety-Kleen Sustainability Solutions is expected to see a significant increase in adjusted EBITDA due to favorable market conditions and base oil pricing gains. Over the next five years, Clean Harbors aims for organic growth exceeding U.S. GDP by 1-2%, annual adjusted EBITDA margin improvement of 30-50 basis points, and adjusted free cash flow exceeding $300 million by 2025.
