In Q3, the company's sales declined 26% to $410 million, primarily driven by a 42% decrease in commercial sales due to the pandemic. However, government and defense sales increased 4% to 49% of total sales. Despite the sales decline, the company's adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations improved 19% sequentially to $0.37. Excluding the benefit of the CARES Act, gross and operating margins increased sequentially due to cost reductions and efficiency gains. Adjusted gross margin improved to 16.1%, reflecting the company's progress in margin improvement. The company generated $18 million in cash from operations and remains in a strong financial position with positive net debt and unused capacity under its credit facility. The company's government businesses continued to perform well, and it secured new business wins during the quarter, including an expanded distribution relationship with GE subsidiary Unison and continued support of the Navy's H-60 Seahawk platform. The company expects modest sequential improvement in Q4 as vaccine distribution progresses and travel restrictions are lifted.
