Rayonier reported strong Q3 results, driven by solid contributions from all timber segments and an exceptional performance in real estate. Adjusted EBITDA reached $115 million, reflecting a 71% increase over the previous year's quarter. Despite headwinds such as constrained production due to weather and trucking shortages, the company experienced favorable timber demand and pricing, particularly in New Zealand. Real estate sales totaled $93 million, with $64 million in adjusted EBITDA, as they closed on significant development transactions. The company raised its full-year 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $320 million to $330 million due to strong performance and favorable long-term market trends. Rayonier completed its exit from the timber fund business and recycled capital from nonstrategic assets, positioning the company for future growth.
