In 2021, EnPro achieved a successful year marked by portfolio reshaping, organic sales growth of 14.4%, and a 23.8% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $208.4 million. This shift towards growth markets and higher-margin products has positioned the company for future success. Despite raw material inflation and supply chain challenges, EnPro anticipates continued strong demand in 2022. The company has implemented pricing actions and remains focused on cost reduction to mitigate these headwinds. EnPro's 2022 guidance projects low double-digit revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $263 million to $275 million, implying adjusted EBITDA margins north of 20%. This growth is driven by robust order trends in key markets such as semiconductor, aerospace, and healthcare. The company remains committed to capital allocation and sustainability, with its aftermarket revenue approaching 50% of total revenue. EnPro emphasizes the importance of its employees and their resilience amidst pandemic-related challenges.
