U.S. Bancorp reported Q3 earnings per share of $1.30 and total revenue of $5.9 billion, showcasing growth in core loans, fee revenue, and robust credit quality. The company released $310 million of loan loss reserves, reflecting an improved economic outlook and strong credit trends. Net interest income remained stable, driven by higher loan fees and core loan growth. Non-interest income rose by 2.8% due to strong growth in payments revenue and mortgage revenue. Non-interest expenses increased slightly, primarily due to higher revenue-related compensation. The bank's CET1 ratio strengthened to 10.2%, and it anticipates acquiring Union Bank to drive growth and synergies. The company expects net interest income to remain stable in Q4, while total payments revenue is projected to strengthen. Credit quality remains solid, with a low net charge-off ratio anticipated over the next few quarters. U.S. Bancorp remains optimistic about its organic growth opportunities and believes its secular growth initiatives, such as connecting payments with banking, will yield significant market share gains in the future.
