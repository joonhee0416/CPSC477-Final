CooperVision and CooperSurgical reported record quarterly revenues, driving record earnings. Constant-currency consolidated revenues rose 32% to $720 million, with CooperVision up 25% to $523 million and CooperSurgical up 58% to $197 million. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.38. Strong performance was seen in silicone hydrogel daily lenses, MyDay, and clariti, which grew 31%, aided by a $2.4 billion global market opportunity for older hydrogels transitioning to silicones. Biofinity, particularly Biofinity Energys and Toric Multifocal, also contributed to growth. Key product launches include clariti, MyDay Sphere, MyDay Toric, Biofinity Toric Multifocal, and the upcoming MyDay Multifocal, which has received positive feedback in clinical testing. With capital expansion projects nearing completion, gross margins are expected to remain solid. The company acquired No7 Contact Lens and OBP Medical, aligning with the strategic focus of CooperVision and CooperSurgical. Fiscal 2021 guidance was updated with consolidated revenue projected to grow 14-15% to $2.855-$2.885 billion and non-GAAP EPS estimated at $13.20-$13.40. Free cash flow is anticipated to exceed $500 million.
