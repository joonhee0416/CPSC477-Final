AECOM reported strong financial performance in fiscal 2021, exceeding expectations in adjusted EBITDA, earnings per share (EPS), and net service revenue (NSR). Organic NSR growth accelerated in the fourth quarter, driven by solid contributions from both the Americas and International segments. The company's adjusted operating margin hit record levels at 14.8% in Q4 and 13.8% for the full year, demonstrating the high value provided to clients and the effectiveness of AECOM's delivery platform. Notably, AECOM achieved a 30-basis-point increase in NSR growth to approximately 6% in 2022 and a further 30-basis-point margin expansion to 14.1%. The company expects a 26% effective tax rate going forward, resulting in a more first-half weighted earnings per share phasing in fiscal 2022. AECOM remains committed to investing in organic growth and digital innovation, positioning it to achieve adjusted earnings per share of at least $4.75 in fiscal 2024, a 10% increase from previous projections and a 20% compounded annual growth rate from 2021 to 2024.
