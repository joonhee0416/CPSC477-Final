PGE reported a net income of $50 million or $0.56 per share for Q3 2021, a significant improvement from the $17 million loss reported in Q3 2020. This brings the year-to-date revenue up 12% over 2020. PGE reaffirmed its 2021 earnings guidance range of $2.70 to $2.85 per share and maintains its long-term earnings growth guidance of 4% to 6% from the 2019 base year. The company is committed to investing in clean energy initiatives, with plans to procure 1,500 to 2,000 megawatts of additional carbon-free resources and 800 megawatts of non-emitting capacity resources by 2030. PGE believes approximately one-third of the clean energy resources needed to meet its 2030 emissions target reductions could be procured through an RFP to be issued in December.
