Vail Resorts reported impressive financial performance for Q2, with net income reaching $223.4 million ($5.47 per diluted share). Resort net revenue surpassed expectations, despite challenges related to staffing and COVID-19. The company's lodging business excelled with strong average daily rates. Season-to-date total skier visits increased by 2.8%, and total lift ticket revenue grew by 10.3% compared to fiscal 2020. The success of Vail's advance commitment strategy contributed to revenue stability. However, ancillary lines of business faced revenue declines, particularly in food and beverage.

Despite a challenging start to the season, Vail has revised its fiscal 2022 outlook upward, now expecting resort reported EBITDA between $813 million and $837 million. This adjustment reflects strong visitation numbers and lodging performance. Vail is also making significant investments in employees and resorts. Minimum wages will increase to $20 per hour for the 2022/2023 season, representing an estimated $175 million increase in labor expenses. Additionally, the company plans to invest in data-driven marketing and self-service capabilities, as well as its Commitment to Zero initiative for environmental sustainability.
