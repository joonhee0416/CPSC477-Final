Vail Resorts' fiscal 2022 second quarter exceeded expectations despite challenges early in the season. Visitation trends and resort demand have improved, especially during January. Despite the impact of COVID-19 restrictions, resort net revenue increased 5% compared to 2020, with strong results in lodging and an average daily rate above expectations. The company's estimated incremental resort reported EBITDA in fiscal 2022 is $182 million if conditions return to normal, but this is offset by an approximate $175 million increase in labor expenses. Vail Resorts' net income increased to $223.4 million, resulting in earnings per share of $5.47. The company is investing in technology, guest engagement, and energy efficiency, with a $4 million investment in its "Commitment to Zero" initiative. Despite challenges in fiscal 2022, the company is optimistic about the future and committed to delivering an exceptional guest experience.
