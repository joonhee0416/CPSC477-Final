In Q3 2020, Tennant reported organic sales improvements despite a decline from the previous year, with sales declines primarily in EMEA due to region-specific factors. The Americas saw strong AMR platform performance and growth in Brazil, while APAC experienced declines in Southeast Asia and Korea. Notably, service and parts revenue increased 6% year-over-year, offsetting a 12% decline in equipment sales. Despite strategic investments and lower volume, Tennant's adjusted EBITDA growth exceeded expectations as a percentage of sales. The company has reestablished its full-year guidance for 2020, projecting net sales between $995 million and $1.005 billion, adjusted EPS between $2.80 and $3.00, and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $116 million to $121 million. Tennant's continued execution of its enterprise strategy involves investments in innovative products and the appointment of a new SVP of Operations to optimize supply chain and operations.
