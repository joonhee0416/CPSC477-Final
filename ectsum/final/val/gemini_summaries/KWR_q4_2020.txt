Quaker Houghton reports a 5% sequential sales increase in Q4, primarily driven by volume recovery and strong performance in EMEA. Despite revenue being down 1% compared to pre-COVID levels, the company achieved a 4% net share gain, contributing to its overall performance. Volumes saw a decline in global specialty due to reduced aerospace maskant sales. The company completed two small bolt-on acquisitions to expand its product portfolio, adding an estimated $11 million in EBITDA for 2021. Adjusted EBITDA improved to $65 million in Q4 and $222 million for the full year, with margins expanding due to realized synergies. Operating cash flow reached a record high, allowing the company to reduce net debt by 12% and pay dividends. Quaker Houghton projects a >20% increase in adjusted EBITDA and further margin expansion in 2021 as synergy benefits are fully realized.
