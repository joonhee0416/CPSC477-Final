Westwood Holdings reported first-quarter earnings per share of $0.13, below $0.30 in Q4 2019, due to lower total revenues and unrealized losses. Revenue of $16.7 million also fell year-over-year from $23.9 million due to lower average assets under management. Non-GAAP economic earnings per share were $0.50, slightly below $0.64 in Q4 2019 but above $0.49 in Q1 2019. The company's U.S. Value Equity products outperformed their benchmarks, with the flagship LargeCap Value strategy ahead of the Russell 1000 Value Index for multiple time periods. Westwood's Multi-Asset and Emerging Markets strategies also exhibited resilience, although performance in Emerging Markets was impacted by asset class underperformance and currency sell-offs. Net institutional and intermediary outflows totaled $560 million, with SmallCap recording inflows. Cost-cutting initiatives will yield savings of over $750,000 in 2020, including the outsourcing of trading operations. Investment infrastructure improvements such as the partnership with InvestCloud and a new credit opportunities fund launch position the company for future growth.
