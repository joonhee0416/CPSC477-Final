Ruger's Q3 financial performance exhibited a significant increase in profitability compared to Q3 2020, with net sales reaching $178.2 million and diluted earnings of $1.98 per share. This growth was driven by increased sales and production, leading to favorable fixed cost leveraging. However, profitability declined slightly from Q2 2021 due to a production shutdown, increased COVID-19 cases, and decreased resale excess. Despite these factors, Ruger remains in a strong financial position with $192.7 million in cash and short-term investments, no debt, and a book value of $19.21 per share. The company's debt-free balance sheet provides stability and flexibility to navigate challenges. New product development continues to drive growth, with new product sales accounting for 22% of firearm sales in the first nine months of 2021. Ruger remains optimistic about the fourth quarter and 2022, with demand for its products remaining strong and distributor and retail inventories being replenished. The company is also investing in new production initiatives, including the return of Marlin lever action rifles.
