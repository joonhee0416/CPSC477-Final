In 2021, Devon Energy achieved record-breaking financial results, driven by its commitment to capital discipline, innovation, and cash returns to shareholders. The company's operational excellence and merger synergies resulted in a significant increase in free cash flow, which was strategically deployed through a robust dividend policy, share buybacks, and debt reduction. Despite inflationary pressures, Devon's projected capital expenditures of $1.9-$2.2 billion will sustain production at 570,000-600,000 Boe per day in 2022. The company's unique dividend strategy offers a compelling alternative for yield-seeking investors, with an estimated 8% yield in 2022. Devon plans to continue opportunistic share repurchases, with a $1.6 billion authorization, trading at a substantial discount to intrinsic value. By prioritizing capital efficiency and margin expansion, Devon is well-positioned to deliver free cash flow growth of over 70% in 2022, translating into a free cash flow yield of 14% at an $85 WTI price. With a disciplined operating framework and a commitment to innovation, Devon remains at the forefront of the energy industry, driving shareholder value through a focus on cash returns and sustainable growth.
