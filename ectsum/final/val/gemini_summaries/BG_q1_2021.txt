Bunge reports a sixth consecutive quarter of increased earnings, driven by strong Agribusiness performance, particularly in oilseed processing and merchandising. Refined and Specialty Oils also achieved a record quarter due to tightened global supplies and improved demand. The company raised its full-year adjusted earnings per share forecast to approximately $7.50, supported by favorable market conditions and increased demand in multiple segments. Additionally, Bunge strengthened its balance sheet, with a net debt ratio of 91% funded by equity. The trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC was 18.7%, exceeding the weighted average cost of capital by 12.1%, demonstrating effective utilization of working capital. The company's strong cash flow generation and discretionary cash flow yield of nearly 29% support balance sheet enhancement, growth investments, and shareholder returns. Despite uncertainties in the second half of the year, Bunge remains confident in its capabilities and business model, pursuing projects to meet growing demand and continue connecting farmers to consumers.
