UPS's third-quarter performance surpassed expectations, driven by improved revenue quality and strong expense control. Consolidated revenue grew 9.2% to $23.2 billion, with all three operating segments seeing year-over-year operating profit improvement and double-digit margins. Notably, the U.S. SMB average daily volume increased by 10.9%, while productivity increased by 2.5% in the same region. In addition to delivering over 1 billion vaccine doses by the end of the year with exceptional delivery precision, UPS also reported a record operating profit of $448 million for its supply chain solutions segment. The company's disciplined focus on capital allocation resulted in $11.8 billion in cash from operations and a $5 billion share repurchase program. Despite challenges, UPS raised its full-year guidance with revenue growth of approximately 13.8% and an operating margin of around 13%. The company anticipates strong demand during peak season and remains laser-focused on achieving its 2023 targets.
