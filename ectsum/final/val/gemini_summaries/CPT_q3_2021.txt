Camden's strong performance continues, with the company reporting another solid quarter. Same-property revenue growth exceeded expectations at 5.1%, boosted by double-digit growth in Phoenix, South Florida, and Tampa. Occupancy remains high at 97.3%, fueled by strong new lease and renewal gains. Despite increased insurance expenses, the company raised its full-year same-store NOI guidance to 4.5% and FFO guidance to $5.34-$5.40 per share. For the fourth quarter, FFO per share is projected at $1.46-$1.52, driven by higher rental rates and lower expenses. The company's financial position is robust, with net debt-to-EBITDA at 4.4 times. Camden's focus on markets with high employment and population growth has paid off, as eight of its markets ranked in the top 10 for 2022 investor demand. Overall, the company is well-positioned to continue its strong performance in the coming year.
