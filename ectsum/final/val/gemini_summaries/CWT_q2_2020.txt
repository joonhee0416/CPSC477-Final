During the second quarter, the company reported a net income decrease to $5.3 million ($0.11 per share), attributed primarily to the absence of rate relief from the California General Rate Case (GRC). The company estimated that it would have gained an additional $29.1 million in pre-tax income if the Commission had rendered a favorable decision on the GRC. The delay in the settlement agreement amounted to $10.9 million, while $18.2 million represents income from disputed cost recovery regulatory mechanisms. Increased production expenses and pension benefits would have been offset by these regulatory mechanisms had they been in place. Despite these challenges, the company's net income for the year-to-date decreased to a loss of $15 million due to similar GRC-related factors.
