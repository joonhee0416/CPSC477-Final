Extra Space Storage reported strong Q3 results, highlighted by its 2000th store opening, exceptional occupancy (over 97%), and robust pricing power. Same-store revenue surged 18.4% year-over-year, driven by a 43% increase in new customer rates compared to 2020 levels. The company's external growth initiatives also contributed to 41.2% FFO growth, leading to an upward revision of its annual FFO guidance to between $6.75 and $6.85 per share. Despite higher wage pressures, operating expenses were reduced, including a 3% savings in payroll. The company's financial position remains strong, with reduced net debt to EBITDA of 4.5 times and ample access to capital through bond offerings and its ATM. Extra Space Storage remains optimistic about its future prospects, driven by ongoing high demand and its diversified portfolio.
