In Q1, the company experienced a 13.4% organic sales decline, an improvement over Q4's 18.4% decline. Order activity has improved throughout the quarter, and internal growth initiatives are gaining traction. Maintenance activity and break/fix requirements are increasing as customer facilities reopen and production ramps up. The company's acquisition of Advanced Control Solutions is expected to contribute $6 million in sales in Q2. Q2 organic sales are projected to decline 13-14% year-over-year, with a low double-digit to low-teen decremental margin. Despite limited visibility, the company is encouraged by the start of the year and believes it is well-positioned to capitalize on the recovery. The company's strong cash generation potential and normalized annual free cash target of at least 100% of net income remain intact.
