Fortive's Q3 performance exceeded expectations, with a 2.3% increase in total sales, driven by acquisitions and favorable exchange rates. While core revenue remained flat, the company achieved an 8% rise in adjusted earnings per share to $0.94. Despite ongoing headwinds, Fortive expanded its core operating margins by 160 basis points, resulting in a margin of 22.7%. The successful spin-off of Vontier and subsequent reduction of net debt has positioned Fortive as a leader in essential technologies for connected workflow solutions. The company's Intelligent Operating Solutions, Precision Technologies, and Advanced Health Care Solutions segments hold leading positions in their respective markets and present significant growth opportunities. For Q4, Fortive projects a revenue increase of 0-3% and incremental margins of approximately 35%.
