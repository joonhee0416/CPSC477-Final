Raymond James Financial reported an outstanding fiscal fourth quarter and year, with record quarterly net revenues of $2.7 billion and net income of $429 million, or earnings per diluted share of $2.02. Excluding acquisition-related expenses, adjusted earnings per diluted share reached $2.06. Revenue growth was driven by record investment banking revenues and assets under management fees. Total client assets under administration reached $1.18 trillion, a 27% year-over-year increase. The firm recruited a record number of financial advisors, with $330 million in trailing 12-month production and $54 billion in client assets. The Private Client Group generated $83 billion in domestic net new assets, while Raymond James Bank experienced solid loan growth. Liquidity and capital remained strong, with the bank's loan portfolio showing healthy credit quality. Despite strong results, share repurchases are suspended until after the acquisition of TriState Capital Holdings. With strong capital ratios and continued focus on growth initiatives, including acquisitions, Raymond James is well-positioned for fiscal 2022.
