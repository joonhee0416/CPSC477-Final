SunCoke's Q3 performance was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in lower volumes and adjusted EBITDA. Despite challenges, the company maintained cost discipline. Notable achievements include the extension of the Haverhill II contract and preparations for entering the foundry coke market in 2021. SunCoke reported a Q3 loss per share of $0.03, with adjusted EBITDA decreasing to $47.8 million compared to $66.7 million in Q3 2019. Domestic coke operations adjusted EBITDA decreased due to lower volumes, partially offset by lower operating costs. Logistics adjusted EBITDA declined by $5.3 million due to lower volumes and pricing. The company remains focused on reducing gross leverage to below three times and has repurchased SXCP notes to that end. SunCoke is confident in its revised financial targets and has implemented cost-cutting measures to optimize operations.
