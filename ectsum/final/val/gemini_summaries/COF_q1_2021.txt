Capital One reported quarterly earnings of $3.3 billion, an increase of 1% from the previous quarter, with diluted earnings per share at $7.03. Despite a loss on their Snowflake investment, the company benefited from a provision gain of $823 million and released $1.6 billion in loan loss allowance reserves due to improved credit performance and an optimistic economic outlook. However, allowance coverage levels declined slightly across all segments, with domestic card coverage at 10.5% and branded card coverage at 12.1%. Net interest margin declined by 6 basis points due to fewer days in the quarter and a higher cash mix. The company's CET1 capital ratio strengthened to 14.6%, supported by share repurchases of $490 million. Credit card revenue declined due to the pandemic, but auto loan revenue surged and consumer banking revenue grew by 22%. Commercial banking revenue also increased, while the annualized charge-off rate remained low at 9 basis points. Overall, Capital One reported strong earnings driven by credit improvements and investments in technology transformation, reinforcing its long-term strategic focus.
