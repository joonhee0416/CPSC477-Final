Worthington Industries had a strong start to its fiscal year with record earnings of $2.46 per share, excluding one-time items. Consolidated net sales reached $1.1 billion, driven by higher steel prices and increased volumes. Steel Processing net sales nearly doubled to $823 million, with a 13% adjusted EBIT margin due to increased demand, higher spreads, and inventory holding gains. The Consumer Products segment saw a slight uptick in revenues with the inclusion of GTI sales, while EBIT margin decreased due to higher costs. Despite challenges in the operating environment, demand remains strong across most end markets, except for automotive due to semiconductor-related slowdowns. Working capital needs led to a decrease in free cash flow, but this is expected to reverse if steel prices decline. The company maintains a strong balance sheet with significant cash and borrowing capacity, and it continues to pursue growth initiatives through innovation, M&A, and sustainability efforts.
