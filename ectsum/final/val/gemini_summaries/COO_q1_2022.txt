CooperVision led the first quarter with strong organic growth of 14%, fueled by daily silicone hydrogel lenses, MyDay and clariti, which grew 25%. CooperSurgical also performed well, reaching a new high with 30% growth, driven by its fertility business and the successful integration of Generate Life Sciences. Overall, consolidated revenues reached $787 million, with non-GAAP earnings per share at $3.24. Despite currency headwinds negatively impacting EPS by $0.37, Cooper updated its full-year guidance to $13.70-$14.20 non-GAAP EPS, with revenue growth of 6.5% to 8.5% organically. The company also announced the pending acquisition of Cook Medical's reproductive health business, which will enhance Cooper's international fertility footprint and add synergistic labor and delivery medical devices, contributing an estimated $0.60 non-GAAP EPS accretion in year one.
