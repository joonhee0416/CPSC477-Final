RPT Realty (RPT) weathered the initial impact of the pandemic with ample liquidity, operational excellence, and strategic planning. As of May 8, 58% of April rent was collected, largely from open tenants. The company has implemented a tiering system to assess tenant health and negotiate rent deferrals and abatements; only six abatements have been granted while 121 deferrals have been approved. RPT's focus on grocery-anchored centers has proven advantageous, with negotiations underway with top-tier grocers to enhance cash flow stability. The company's strong balance sheet, with no debt maturing in 2020 and only modest maturities in 2021 and 2022, provides liquidity to withstand the downturn. RPT remains committed to providing a sustainable dividend in the future once the impact of the pandemic becomes clearer.
