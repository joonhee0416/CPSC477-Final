The Hartford reported strong second-quarter results, with core earnings of $836 million and a 91% increase in earnings per share. The company's excellent financial performance reflects strong execution and a strategic focus on high-return businesses. Property & Casualty performed exceptionally, with improved results driven by higher investment income and strong growth in Commercial Lines. Commercial Lines saw double-digit top-line growth, underlying margin expansion, and reduced COVID impact, particularly in Small, Middle & Large, and Global Specialty businesses. Total written premium for the quarter increased by 15%, including higher audit and endorsement premiums from the economic rebound. Group Benefits also had solid results, with higher earned premiums, favorable disability trends, and a lessening effect of excess mortality related to COVID-19. The Hartford's net unrealized gains on fixed maturities before tax rose to $2.8 billion, and the company returned $694 million to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends. Despite some moderation, the overall economic expansion is expected to continue, positively impacting the premium base of employment-centric businesses. However, the company is closely monitoring recent elevated inflation data and considering pricing actions to address this in the future. The Hartford's investment portfolio remains well-positioned for the evolving macroeconomic environment.
