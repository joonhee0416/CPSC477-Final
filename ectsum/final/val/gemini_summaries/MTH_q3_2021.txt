Meritage Homes experienced strong home buying activity in Q3, with record high demand and home closing gross margin (29.7%), driven by limited housing supply, low interest rates, and demand from millennials and baby boomers. The company set new records for home closings (3,112), gross margin, and diluted earnings per share ($5.25). Meritage's focus on entry-level and first move-up homes, coupled with its strategic supply chain partnerships, allowed it to navigate ongoing supply challenges. Community count grew to 236, with plans to reach 300 by mid-2022. Ongoing investment in land acquisition and development ($526 million in Q3) will support double-digit growth in unit and home closing revenue for 2022. Despite potential headwinds from supply chain delays, high commodity costs, and lumber price increases, Meritage remains optimistic about continued market share expansion and profitability.
