Clean Harbors reported strong Q1 results, with revenues up 10% and a record adjusted EBITDA of $122.6 million. The Environmental Services segment saw impressive growth, while Safety-Kleen's rerefining spread has been impacted by the oil shock from the coronavirus pandemic. The company has taken significant actions to address the downturn, including cost-cutting measures, reducing capital expenditures, and drawing down on its revolving credit facility. Clean Harbors expects the second quarter to be challenging, particularly for Safety-Kleen, but remains optimistic about its long-term prospects. The company has a strong balance sheet and believes it is well-positioned to emerge from the crisis stronger than some of its peers.
