In the third quarter, the company experienced strong sequential financial performance, exceeding high-end guidance estimates. This led to an upward revision of full-year guidance for revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted diluted EPS. The third quarter's performance was driven by improvements in clinical research accessibility, increased patient recruitment, and the resilience of the Technology & Analytics Solutions (TAS) segment. TAS remained mission-critical for clients, with strong demand for its offerings leading to the addition of 45 OCE clients this year. While the CSMS business continues to face challenges due to soft demand for field reps, existing clients have retained engagements. In 2021, the company anticipates a continuation of the recovery trend, with revenue growth of 10.1% to 12.8%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 16.1% to 19.3%, and adjusted earnings per share growth of 21.4% to 26.2% compared to 2020 guidance midpoints.
